    "solution": "We can interpret the information as saying that it takes us at least $5$ coin flips to obtain our first heads. We want to find the probability that it takes up no more than $8$ coin flips to obtain our first heads. The \"at least $5$ flips\" portion means that the first $4$ flips were all tails. Therefore, from $4$ tails, find the probability the first head occurs on or before the $8$th flip. Given the memorylessness of the geometric distribution, this is really asking the probability we obtain a heads in the next $4$ flips. The complement is easy to compute, which is the event that we don't obtain a heads in the next $4$ flips. The probability of all tails for the next $4$ flips is $\\dfrac{3^4}{4^4} = \\dfrac{81}{256}$. Therefore, the probability we do get a heads in the next $4$ flips is $1 - \\dfrac{81}{256} = \\dfrac{175}{256}$.",

    "task": "A $3$-headed dragon is attacking your village! You, the mightiest of knights, are tasked with taking down this dragon with your trusty sword. The dragon is defeated if you chop off all of its heads. However, this dragon uses magic and has the ability to grow heads over time! If you attack the dragon, one of three events can happen. You either chop of $2$ of its heads, you chop of $1$ head (which will ALWAYS grow back), or you miss entirely and the dragon grows $1$ head. The probability you chop of $2$ heads and miss the dragon are the same (assuming the dragon has $2$ or more heads). You know that if the dragon has $5$ or more heads, the dragon is too strong for you to take care of (in which case you and the rest of the villagers will perish). What is the probability you defeat the dragon?",
    "hint": "How can we model the different states of this scenario?",
    "solution": "Since there are changing states to this situation, we need to employ a Markov Chain to answer this question. Each state is differentiated by the amount of heads the dragon has. Let $P_{x}$ be the probability you defeat the dragon when the dragon is at $x$ heads. We already know that $P_{0}=1$ and $P_{5}=0$, thus we need to make equations for every other state in between. Also, its important to notice you are either going to a state with two less, the same amount, or one more head. Since the probability of going down two heads is the same as one more head, the probability of each scenario happening is $\\frac{1}{2}$ as if you repeat the same state, you'll still have to either go down two heads or up one head again. Also, when the dragon is at one head, you will either stay at the same number or increase the number of heads by one, so $P_{1}=P_{2}$. Every other state equation is as follows: $$P_{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot P_{0}+\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot P_{3}$$ $$P_{3} = \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot P_{1}+\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot P_{4}$$ $$P_{4} = \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot P_{2} + \\frac{1}{3}\\cdot P_{5}$$ Solving all these equations, we obtain the answer of $P_{3} = \\frac{3}{5}$.",

The event $\\{N \\geq k\\}$ here means that none of the first $k-1$ people in the room share adjacent birthdays. Each birthday removes $3$ possible days for the remaining people to have. Therefore, the $i$th person entering the room has $365 - 3(i-1) = 368 - 3i$ possible days for their birthday to not have it overlap with any other birthday. This means that $$\\mathbb{P}[N \\geq k] = \\dfrac{365}{365} \\cdot \\dfrac{362}{365} \\cdot \\dfrac{359}{365} \\cdot \\dots \\cdot \\dfrac{368 - 3k}{365} = \\dfrac{\\displaystyle \\prod_{i=1}^k (368-3i)}{365^k}$$ Now, we sum over the support of $N$. There are $365$ possible birthdays, and each person entering removes up to $3$ days. Therefore, we know that $N \\leq 122$ with probability $1$, as with $122$ people, there must be a pair that is adjacent. This is because if none were adjacent, the $122$ people would block out $122 \\cdot 3 = 366 > 365$ days, which is not possible. Thus, two must overlap. Therefore, we can stop our sum at $122$. Our final expectation is $$\\mathbb{E}[N] = \\displaystyle \\sum_{k=1}^{122} \\dfrac{\\displaystyle \\prod_{i=1}^k (368-3i)}{365^k} \\approx 13.5$$",

    "hint": "Consider the set $S = \\{2,3,4,5,6,7,8\\}$. These are the unvisited vertices of the frog.

    "solution": "The frog must hop $7$ times to visit all of the lily pads, so there are $7!$ ways it can move. Consider the set $S = \\{2,3,4,5,6,7,8\\}$. These are the unvisited vertices of the frog.

However, we have to be careful here, as if either $B$ is empty or the entire set $\\{2,3,4,5,6,7,8\\}$, no left hop occurs. However, there are other cases as well. Namely, to not left hop, the set $A$ must contain elements such that $\\text{max}(A) < \\text{min}(B)$. This occurs exactly when $A$ contains the starting sequence of the elements. This would mean we exclude $A = \\{2\\}, \\{2,3\\}, \\{2,3,4\\}, \\dots, \\{2,3,4,5,6,7\\}$ (we already excluded the full set). This adds $6$ additional sets we must exclude. Therefore, Therefore, we must remove $8$ elements from the $2^7 = 128$ possibilities of how we can create the subsets. Therefore, our answer is $$\\dfrac{2^7 - 8}{7!} = \\dfrac{1}{42}$$",

In the 4-tiger case, each tiger understands that if it eats the sheep, then it will be eaten after turning into a sheep, since they know that the sheep is eaten in the 3-tiger case.

If we choose a normal vector uniformly at random, then the corresponding plane with that normal vector passing through the origin splits the sphere into two parts. Find the expected number of edges that the plane passes through.",
    "hint": "Set up indicators representing if each edge is passed through or not.",
    "solution": "There will be $\\displaystyle \\binom{6}{2} = 15$ total edges on the sphere. Label these edges $1-15$, and let $X_i$ be the indicator of the event that the plane intersects the $i$th edge. Then $T = X_1 + \\dots + X_{15}$ gives the total number of edges that are intersected by the plane. Suppose that we have two points on our sphere. We want to find the probability that the segment between them is intersected by the plane. The key here is that we draw a vector from the origin to the two points that we consider. The angle between those two vectors will be somewhere in $(0,\\pi)$. The cosine of the angle between the two points is the dot product of their vectors, as they are already magnitude $1$. Therefore, if the two points are labelled $1$ and $2$ and their corresponding vectors are $v_1$ and $v_2$, we have that the angle $\\theta$ between them satisfies $\\cos\\theta = v_1 \\cdot v_2$. In other words, $\\theta = \\arccos(v_1 \\cdot v_2)$. As the angle with the origin of our normal direction is uniform on $(0,\\pi)$ we have that the probability of intersection is just $\\dfrac{\\arccos(v_1\\cdot v_2)}{\\pi}$. Our final task then is to compute this for every pair of points. The pairs of points that we have here are nice in the sense that many are orthogonal to one another. In particular, there are only three pairs of points that are not orthogonal, which are $(1,0,0)$ with $(-1,0,0)$, $(0,1,0)$ with $(0,-1,0)$, and $(0,0,1)$ with $(0,0,-1)$. The dot product of all of these pairs of points is $-1$, so $\\arccos(-1) = \\pi$. For the other $12$ segments, we have $\\arccos(0) = \\dfrac{\\pi}{2}$. Therefore, we get that $$\\mathbb{E}[T] = 12 \\cdot \\dfrac{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}{\\pi} + 3 \\cdot \\dfrac{\\pi}{\\pi} = 9$$",

It is known that the egg will break at some floor number $1-n$. What is the maximum value of $n$ such that at most $9$ drops are required to determine $X$ in the worst-case scenario?",
    "hint": "In Egg Drop I, the strategy was to keep the worst case constant by scaling how high we jump at each interval based on how far up it is in our tower. In other words, make larger jumps at lower floors in the tower so that you can test every floor afterwards in a given range. Namely, with at most $d$ drops and $2$ eggs, you could test $\\dfrac{d(d+1)}{2}$ floors completely. The key here is to note that when you drop one egg and it breaks, the problem is reduced down to the two egg case. Therefore, instead of making jumps that decrease linearly (which is what you do in the two egg case), make jumps that decrease by the maximum increment of the two egg case.",
    "solution": "In Egg Drop I, the strategy was to keep the worst case constant by scaling how high we jump at each interval based on how far up it is in our tower.

Namely, with at most $d$ drops and $2$ eggs, we could test $\\dfrac{d(d+1)}{2}$ floors completely. The key here is to note that when we drop one egg and it breaks, we really get reduced down to the two egg case. Therefore, instead of making jumps that decrease linearly (which is what we do in the two egg case), we are going to make jumps that decrease by the maximum increment of the two egg case. This is so that we are sufficiently able to search everything in a given range in the two egg case afterwards. Putting this into math, we want to find a first cutoff point such that if the egg breaks at floor $X$ on the first drop, we can examine the floors below it in $9-1 = 8$ trials. We can examine up to $\\dfrac{8 \\cdot 9}{2} = 36$ floors in $8$ trials by Egg Drop I, so we should drop our first egg at floor $37$. If it doesn't break, then we need to increment such that if it breaks on our next trial, we can examine the remaining space between $37$ and the next floor in $9-2 = 7$ drops. We can explore up to $\\dfrac{8 \\cdot 7}{2} = 28$ floors with $7$ drops, so we should place our next egg at floor $66$ such that we can explore floors $38-65$ ($28$ floors) in the remaining $7$ drops. Continuing this pattern, when we have $k$ drops left, we are going to increment by $\\dfrac{k(k+1)}{2} + 1$ floors. This means that the next egg after would be placed at floor $66 + 21 + 1 = 88$, the egg after at $88 + 15 + 1 = 104$, and so on. The remaining floors to drop eggs at would be $115, 122, 126,$ and $128$. If it breaks at $128$ but not at $126$, we try $127$ to verify the answer. If it doesn't break at $128$, we try $129$ instead and see if it breaks. If it breaks, we found our answer. If it doesn't break, then if $n = 130$, we would know that the egg breaks at floor $130$, as it must break on one of the floors in our building. We can't explore any higher than $130$ due to the fact that if it breaks at some point above $130$, we would have to search between $129$ and the breaking point, which takes strictly more than one egg drop. Therefore, $n =130$ is our answer.",

    "solution": "To get a baseline to compare to, suppose we just roll and take in an alternating fashion. We will be able to perform this $50$ times (as each is one action) and the expected value per roll is $10.5$, so our expected payout would be $50 \\cdot 10.5 = 525$ with this strategy. Now, let's write the expected payoff as a function of $n$. If we accept any value at least $n$, then the expected value we roll given we accept is $\\dfrac{20+n}{2}$. There are $21-n$ values that are at least value $n$, so the probability on each roll that we obtain a value at least $n$ is $\\dfrac{21-n}{20}$. As this probability is constant between rolls, the expected number of terms of obtain a value at least $n$ is $\\dfrac{20}{21-n}$. However, we now must claim it after we obtain a roll satisfying this threshold, so the expected number of turns needed to roll and claim the money is $\\dfrac{20}{21-n} + 1$. Therefore, on average, we are able to roll and claim the money $\\dfrac{100}{\\frac{20}{21-n} + 1}$ times in the game, as it takes us that many turns on average to roll and claim and we have $100$ total turns. Lastly, this implies our expected payout is $f(n) = \\dfrac{100}{\\frac{20}{21-n} + 1} \\cdot \\dfrac{20+n}{2}$, as we multiply the expected number of times we are paid by the expected payout per time. To find the $n$ maximizing this, one can treat $f$ as continuous and use the derivative of it to find the optimal $n$. The details of taking the derivative messy and not enlightening, so the steps are excluded. However, after using the basic rules and simplifying, $$f'(n) = \\dfrac{50}{(n-41)^2} \\cdot \\left(n^2 - 82n + 461\\right) = 0$$ The roots of the polynomial are $n_{1,2} = 41 \\pm 2\\sqrt{305}$. The root adding $2\\sqrt{305}$ is larger than $20$, so $n^* = 41 - 2\\sqrt{305}$ must be the maximizer. As $17 < \\sqrt{305} < 18$ and our optimal $n$ must be an integer, we can test $n = 5, 6, 7$ to see which gives us the largest expected payout. Plugging all three of these in reveals $n = 6$ maximizes $f(n)$ with payout $\\dfrac{3900}{7}$.",

    "hint": "Note that the first $26$ cards must not be aces (since the first should come on the $27$th turn) nor the $2$ of hearts.",
    "solution": "The denominator is the number of ways to obtain the first ace as the $27$th card dealt. In particular, we permute $26$ of the $48$ non-aces to the first $26$ spots, which can be done in $P(48,26)$ ways. Then, we fix the $27$th card as an ace, which has $4$ options. Then, lastly, we arrange the other $25$ cards in any way we want, so there are $P(48,26) \\cdot 4 \\cdot 25!$ total arrangements with the $27$th card being the first ace. Now, we need to do the same on the numerator, but we have an additional condition to satisfy. Note that the first $26$ cards must not be aces (since the first should come on the $27$th turn) nor the $2$ of hearts. Therefore, we are permuting $26$ of the $47$ remaining cards to the first $26$ spots, yielding $P(47,26)$ possibilities. Then, the $27$th card can be one of $4$ aces. Afterwards, the next card must be fixed as the $2$ of hearts. Then, there are $24$ cards left, so there are $24!$ ways to arrange the cards after the $2$ of hearts.

    "solution": "Let $h_n$ be the number of distinct paths to the top of a $n$ stair staircase. We can condition on the size of the first jump. The size of the first jump can be anywhere from $2$ to $n$, inclusive. If the rabbit hops $k$ stairs on the first step, it must make a unique path through the other $n-k$ stairs. Hence, you could view the problem now as stair $k$ being the floor and the top stair being $n-k$. This means that $$h_n = h_{n-2} + h_{n-3} + h_{n-4} + \\dots + h_{1} + h_0$$ However, let's look at the tail term $h_{n-3} + h_{n-4} + \\dots + h_1 + h_0$. This is equivalent to the problem where we start on stair $1$ (instead of the ground) and need to jump up strictly more than one stair at each jump. This is because stair $3$ would now be the first available stair to jump on, and the rabbit can jump to any other stair at least $3$. Thus, the tail term there is just $h_{n-1}$, as starting on stair $1$, the rabbit needs a path through the other $n-1$ stairs to the top. Our recurrence relation is now $$h_n = h_{n-1} + h_{n-2}$$ Our initial conditions are that $h_1 = 0$ and $h_2 = 1$, which can just be counted directly. We note now that this is just the Fibonacci sequence shifted by $1$ index up, as $F_0 = 0$ and $F_1 = 1$, so we can conclude that $h_n = F_{n-1}$. In particular, this means that $h_{10} = F_9 = 34$.",

Find the probability that her second dart is at least $\\dfrac{R}{2}$ distance away from the center. The answer is in the form $\\dfrac{a + \\ln(b)}{c}$, where the fraction is fully reduced. Find $a + b + c$.",

We already know the PDF of $R_1$, so no more work is needed there. For the first probability, we need to split into two cases. The first is if $R_1 > \\dfrac{R}{2}$. Since from the question we know that Nicole throws her dart further away from the first one, the probability is $1$ in this case, as the first dart is already at least $\\dfrac{R}{2}$ away from the center. The second case is when $0 < R_1 < \\dfrac{R}{2}$. In this case, the second dart lands uniformly throughout the region further away than the first dart. Thus, if $R_1 = r < \\dfrac{R}{2}$. The probability it lies in the annulus larger than $\\dfrac{R}{2}$ in distance is given by taking the ratios of areas. We have that the area of the region larger than $\\dfrac{R}{2}$ in distance is given by $\\pi\\left(R^2 - \\dfrac{R^2}{4}\\right) = \\dfrac{3\\pi R^2}{4}$.

    "solution": "Our optimal strategy will be to be stop once we have at least a sum of $k$ and roll again otherwise. Our goal is to find such a $k$. To do this, we need to find the point at which we are indifferent to rolling again versus cashing out. If we currently have $k$ in the bank, then with probability $1/6$, we bust and get a payout of $0$. With probability $1/6$, we roll a $5$ and obtain a payout of $k$. Otherwise, if we don't roll either of those values, our bank increases by an average of $5/2$, as we roll a value $1-4$ uniformly at random. Therefore, we need to find $k$ such that $$\\dfrac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\dfrac{1}{6} \\cdot k + \\dfrac{2}{3} \\cdot (k + 5/2) = k$$ This equation has the LHS represent the expected payout when rolling again and the RHS represent the expected payout when we stop. Solving this yields $k = 10$. To compute the expected payout of the game, we can use a recursive approach. We set up the recursion here. The largest possible sum attainable under this strategy is $13$, as we would roll again on $9$ and obtain a $4$. Let $E_k$ be the expected payout when our current sum is $k$ under this strategy. We clearly have that $E_{13} = 13, E_{12} = 12, E_{11} = 11,$ and $E_{10} = 10$. For any $k < 10$, we can either cash out $k$ with probability $1/6$ (rolling a $5$), cash out nothing with probability $1/6$ (roll a $6$), or have an expected payout of $E_{k+1},E_{k+2},E_{k+3},$ or $E_{k+4}$ with probability $1/6$ each. Therefore, we have found that for $k < 10$, $$E_k = \\dfrac{k + E_{k+1} + E_{k+2} + E_{k+3} + E_{k+4}}{6}$$ $E_0$ is the value we are interested in looking for, as we start with $0$ at the beginning.

Let's first think about the conditions needed to have no overlap. First, we know that $\\theta_1 < \\alpha$.

    "solution": "Let $I_1,\\dots, I_4$ be the indicator of the event that the $i$th orb's color is guessed correctly. Then $T = I_1 + I_2 + I_3 + I_4$ gives the total profit of the game. By linearity of expectation, $\\mathbb{E}[T] = \\sum_{i=1}^4 \\mathbb{P}[A_i]$, where $A_i$ is the event that the $i$th orb's color is guessed correctly. We want to find a strategy that maximizes $\\mathbb{P}[A_i]$. On the first draw, we have absolutely no information about what color will come out.

Afterwards, once we have observed the color of the first orb, note that the probability that the second orb differs in color from the first orb is $\\dfrac{2}{3}$. This also means the probability they are the same color is $\\dfrac{1}{3}$. Therefore, we should guess the opposite color of the orb to be drawn on the second draw. This means $\\mathbb{P}[A_2] = \\dfrac{2}{3}$. For the third draw, we really need to think about what has come out thus far. If the first two draws are the same color, which occurs with probability $\\dfrac{1}{3}$, then with probability $1$ you know the color of the last two orbs to be drawn, so you should guess that. If they differ, which occurs with probability $\\dfrac{2}{3}$, then you are back at random for the third draw, so you get it correct with probability $\\dfrac{1}{2}$. Therefore, by applying Law of Total Probability via conditioning on the matching or differing colors of the orbs, $\\mathbb{P}[A_3] = \\dfrac{2}{3} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{2} + \\dfrac{1}{3} \\cdot 1 = \\dfrac{2}{3}$.

Therefore, under this strategy, $\\mathbb{E}[T] = \\dfrac{1}{2} + \\dfrac{2}{3} + \\dfrac{2}{3} + 1 = \\dfrac{17}{6}$.

This is simply $16$ windows of probability $1/32$ each, for an expected value of $1/2$. To account for overlaps, let's analyze how many times we want to count consecutive chains of black squares of certain lengths. For example, if we have exactly $6$ black squares in a row, we want to count this as $1$ connected $5$-component, but if there are exactly $10$ black squares in a row, we want to count this as $2$.

    "task": "Gabe has a revolver with six chambers, and he convinces his friend Miriam to play a round of modified Russian roulette with him. He loads two bullets into the gun such that there is exactly one empty chamber between the two loaded chambers. He points the gun at his forehead, pulls the trigger, and survives. He offers Miriam the gun and gives her a choice to either point the gun at herself and pull the trigger (Option $1$) or add a third bullet to the gun, randomly spin the cylinder, and then point the gun at herself and pull the trigger (Option $2$). Which option should she choose to optimize her probability of survival? Enter $1$ for Option $1$, $2$ for Option $2$, or $3$ if the two options are equally optimal.",
    "hint": "If Miriam chooses Option $1$, then her chance of survival is conditioned on the fact that Gabe survived the first round. What could the ordering of the bullets be that allow for this to be the case?",
    "solution": "Consider Option $2$ first. The probability that Miriam survives in this case is $1/2$, since there are $3$ loaded chambers out of $6$ total chambers. Now, let's consider Option $1$. Let $B$ denote the event that Gabe survives the first shot, or in other words, the event that the first chamber is empty. Let $A$ denote the event that Miriam survives the next shot, or in other words, the event that the second chamber is empty. If Miriam chooses Option $1$, then her chance of survival is conditioned on the fact that Gabe survived the first trigger-pull. We therefore wish to determine: $$ \\mathbb{P}(A \\,|\\, B) = \\frac{\\mathbb{P}(A \\cap B)}{\\mathbb{P}(B)} $$ The probability of the first two chambers being empty is $1/3$, and the probability of the first chamber being empty is $2/3$.

Mr. Garrison randomly partitions the $50$ nuggets into four piles such that each partition has an equal chance of occurring. Each student has at least $5$ nuggets after the partition.

    "solution": "We wish to find $\\mathbb{P}(A | B)$, where $A$ is the event that all four students are satisfied, and $B$ is the event that Mr. Garrison's division of the nuggets gives each student at least $5$.

Let's begin with the first sub-problem. We can utilize stars and bars. Since we have $50$ total nuggets and $4$ buckets, we end up with $3$ bars. Let's assign $6$ nuggets into each of the first three groups and $18$ nuggets into the fourth group. This leaves us with $50 - 3 \\cdot 6 - 18 = 14$ nuggets left to split into groups. There are $\\binom{17}{3}$ ways to order our $14$ stars and $3$ bars. Similarly, for the second sub-problem, we can assign $5$ nuggets into each of the four groups. This leaves us with $30$ chicken nuggets (stars) left to be partitioned. There are $\\binom{33}{3}$ ways to order our $30$ stars and $3$ bars.

    "task": "A treasure chest is up for auction and there are $10$ participants participating in the auction. The value of the treasure chest is determined as follows: behind a curtain $20$ fair coins are independently flipped and for each head that shows, $\\$1$ is added to the chest (participants cannot see behind the curtian but are aware of the way the chest is valued). Each person chooses a non-negative integer number of dollars to submit as a sealed bid. The chest goes to a uniformly random person who was among the highest bidders, in return for the amount bid and everyone else has their bid returned. Count how many pure Nash equilibria there are for this game. (You may assume everyone's utility for money is linear in the range $\\$0$ to $\\$10$.) $\\textbf{Note:}$ A pure Nash equilibrium means the strategy of each player must choose a single bid value with probability $1$ (e.g. a player's strategy cannot be to bid $3$ with probability $0.4$ and bid $4$ with probability $0.6$).",
    "hint": "Count the number of Nash Equilibria for which exactly $k$ people bid $\\$10$.",
    "solution": "Let's first simplify the valuation of the chest, since we are interested in Nash equilibria we are interested in a set of strategies such that a $\\textbf{single}$ person cannot increase their $\\textit{expected value}$ from the chest when everyone uses the Nash strategy. Therefore, we can simply think of the chest containing $\\$10$ since this is the expected number of heads. Now we begin with the observation that if one person submits a $\\$10$ bid, then all 10 players at best will have a 0 EV strategy. It is not hard to see the person bidding $\\$10$ will be 0 EV since the chest is $\\$10$ in expectation. As for the remaining 9 people, if any of them bid less than $ \\$10$, they don't win or lose anything since the chest goes to the $\\$10$ bidder and their bid is returned. If they bid exactly $\\$10$ then again this is $0$ EV, and if they bid any more than $\\$10$ their EV is negative so at best the remaining 9 people can do a 0 EV strategy. However, it might be in the interest of a person bidding $\\$10$ to decrease their bid. Consider a strategy where all $9$ people will bid $\\$9$, what should the last person do to maximize their EV? Bidding $\\$10$ here is 0 EV as discussed before, but bidding $\\$9$ is actually positive EV since there is a $\\frac{1}{10}$ probability their $\\$9$ bid wins the chest worth $\\$10$ for netting them a $\\$1$ profit. This motivates our first statement. $\\textbf{Claim:}$ All people bidding $\\$9$ is a Nash Equilibrium. $\\textbf{Proof:}$ The expectation of this strategy for a given person is $\\$0.1$ as shown above. A given person cannot exceed this in expectation since bidding any higher will result in a zero or negative expectation and bidding any lower will result in zero expectation since they will never win the auction due to the other people bidding $\\$9$. Now, we begin to generalize. Let's consider counting the number of Nash Equilibrium by the number of people who are bidding $\\$10$. If there are only 0 people bidding $\\$10$, then the only Nash Equilibrium that can exist is when all bid $\\$9$, if there was someone who was not bidding $\\$9$ then they could increase their expectation by bidding $\\$9$. If there is only 1 person bidding $\\$10$, then no such Nash equilibrium can exist since this person can increase their expectation by bidding $\\$9$. If there are only 2 people bidding $\\$10$, then we claim this is a Nash equilibrium because everyone's strategy has an expected value of 0 and no one can gain by deviating. In fact, this logic holds as long as there are $\\mathit{ at~least }$ 2 people bidding $\\$10$. Therefore, to count the total number of strategies let us reframe the problem. Let's denote a strategy as a 10-d tuple so $S = \\{b_1, b_2, ..., b_{10}\\}$ where $b_i$ denotes the $i-$th person's bid meaning $b_i \\in \\{\\$0, \\$1, ..., \\$10\\}$. To count the number of Nash Equilibria which correspond to at least 2 people bidding $\\$10$ we count the complement. That is, the number of Nash Equilibria with at least 2 people bidding ten = $\\underbrace{11^{10}}_{\\text{all~strategies}} - \\underbrace{10^{10}}_{\\text{no~ten~bids}} - \\underbrace{{10 \\choose 1} 10^{9}}_{\\text{one~ten~bids}} = 5937424601$. Lastly, we must add one in the case of all bids being $\\$9$ giving us our final answer of $5937424602$.",

We condition on the two cases. If the last block is $1-$tall, then there are $T_{n-1}$ valid towers stemming from this case. If the last block is $2-$tall, there are $T_{n-2}$ valid towers stemming from this case. Therefore, we have the recurrence relation $T_n = T_{n-1} + T_{n-2}$. We need $2$ initial conditions, as this is a second-order recurrence. We can clearly see that $T_1 = 1$, as only a $1-$tall block works. Additionally, we see $T_2 = 2$, as we either have a $2-$tall block or two $1-$tall blocks stacked. Now, we see that this is just the Fibonacci Sequence shifted up $1$ term, as the Fibonacci sequence typically starts off with $T_1 = T_2 = 1$. Therefore, $T_n = F_{n+1}$. In particular, $T_{12} = F_{13} = 233$ by using the recurrence.",

    "solution": "Let random variable $X$ denote the minimum number rolled after you repeatedly rolls a die until you get a $5$. Notice that $\\mathbb{P}(X = 6) = 0$, since a $5$ will always be rolled. By the definition of expectation, we have: \\[\\begin{aligned} \\mathbb{E}[X] &= \\sum_{x = 1}^5 x \\cdot \\mathbb{P}(X = x). \\end{aligned}\\] Let's compute $\\mathbb{P}(X = 1)$. In other words, we want to find the probability that there exists at least one $1$ before a $5$ occurs. Notice that there are only two possibilities (we don't care what the numbers between $1$ and $5$ actually are): (1) a $1$ appears before a $5$, or (2) a $5$ appears before a $1$. By symmetry and the law of total probability, we conclude that $\\mathbb{P}(X = 1) = 1/2$. Next, let's compute $\\mathbb{P}(X = 2)$. In order for $2$ to be the minimum value, a $1$ cannot be rolled before the first $5$, and a $2$ must be rolled before the first $5$. Consider an arbitrary sequence of rolled values of infinite length that contains at least one each of $1$, $2$, and $5$. There are a couple possibilities. Just to name a few: (1) $1$ appears before $2$ which appears before $5$, and (2) $2$ appears before $5$ which appears before $1$, and (3) $2$ appears before $1$ which appears before $5$. In total, there are $3! = 6$ ways to order $\\{1, 2, 5\\}$. Only when we have $\\{2, 5, 1\\}$ will we achieve $X = 2$. By symmetry and the law of total probability, for an arbitrary sequence of infinite length, the probability that a $2$ appears before a $5$ which appears before a $1$ is $1/6$. Similarly, for $\\mathbb{P}(X = 3)$, we need to find orderings of $\\{1, 2, 3, 5\\}$ such that $3$ appears before $5$ which appears before $1$ and $2$ in any order. Therefore, $\\mathbb{P}(X = 3) = 2! / 4! = 1/12$. Repeating this logic for $\\mathbb{P}(X = 4)$ and $\\mathbb{P}(X = 5)$, we find $\\mathbb{P}(X = 4) = 3! / 5! = 1/20$ and $\\mathbb{P}(X = 5) = 4! / 5! = 1/5$. Putting it all together, we find: \\[\\begin{aligned} \\mathbb{E}[X] &= \\sum_{x = 1}^5 x \\cdot \\mathbb{P}(X = x) \\\\ &= \\frac{1}{2} + 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} + 3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{12} + 4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{20} + 5 \\cdot \\frac{1}{5} \\\\ &= \\boxed{\\frac{137}{60}}. \\end{aligned}\\]",

    "solution": "Let $N_{(a,b)}$ be the number of steps starting from $(a,b)$ needed to reach the square boundary. We want $\\mathbb{E}[N_{(0,0}]$. We use Law of Total Expectation here to condition on the first step and use the symmetry of our random walk to simplify this problem greatly. Starting from the origin, the ant moves to $(\\pm 1,0)$ or $(0, \\pm 1)$ all with equal probability. However, by the symmetry of our square and our walk, $\\mathbb{E}[N_{(0,1)}] = \\mathbb{E}[N_{(0,-1)}] = \\mathbb{E}[N_{(1,0)}] = \\mathbb{E}[N_{(-1,0)}]$. Therefore, by Law of Total Expectation, \\[\\begin{aligned} \\mathbb{E}[N_{(0,0)}] &= \\dfrac{1}{4}\\left[(1 + \\mathbb{E}[N_{(0,1)}]) + (1 + \\mathbb{E}[N_{(0,-1)}]) + (1 + \\mathbb{E}[N_{(1,0)}]) + (1 + \\mathbb{E}[N_{(-1,0)}])\\right] \\\\ &= 1 + \\mathbb{E}[N_{(1,0)}] \\end{aligned}\\] The additional $1$ added to all of these represents the fact that we take $1$ step to get from the origin to one of these spots. From $(1,0)$, we can reach the boundary in one more step if we move right. If we move up or down, we are going to reach $(1,1)$ or $(1,-1)$. The expected time to reach the boundary from each of these positions is equal by the symmetry of our random walk. If we move left, we are back at the origin. Therefore, by Law of Total Expectation: \\[\\begin{aligned} \\mathbb{E}[N_{(1,0)}] &= \\dfrac{1}{4}\\left(1 + (1 + \\mathbb{E}[N_{(1,1)}]) + (1 + \\mathbb{E}[N_{(1,-1)}]) + (1 + \\mathbb{E}[N_{(0,0)}]\\right) \\\\ &= 1 + \\dfrac{1}{2}\\mathbb{E}[N_{(1,1)}] + \\dfrac{1}{4}\\mathbb{E}[N_{(0,0)}] \\end{aligned}\\] From $(1,1)$, we can reach the boundary in one more step if we move right or up, which occurs with probability $\\dfrac{1}{2}$. Otherwise, we end up at $(1,0)$ or $(0,1)$, and we already know by symmetry that the expected time to hit the boundary from these positions are equal.

Substituting the expressions for $\\mathbb{E}[N_{(1,1)}]$ and $\\mathbb{E}[N_{(0,0)}]$ into the expression for $\\mathbb{E}[N_{(1,0)}]$, we find that $\\mathbb{E}[N_{(1,0)}] = 1 + \\dfrac{1}{2}\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{2}\\mathbb{E}[N_{(1,0)}]\\right) + \\dfrac{1}{4}(1 + \\mathbb{E}[N_{(1,0)}])$. We solve and see that $\\mathbb{E}[N_{(1,0)}] = \\dfrac{7}{2}$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\mathbb{E}[N_{(0,0)}]$, we get $\\mathbb{E}[N_{(0,0)}] = \\dfrac{9}{2}$.",

    "solution": "Let $I$ be the number of steps needed to obtain a singular matrix starting from the identity matrix. This value depends on which value in our matrix is edited first, so let's apply Law of Total Expectation to what value is edited first. If we select one of the diagonal elements, then it is easy to verify we obtain a singular matrix. Otherwise, if we select one of the off-diagonal elements, we end up with either $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ or $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$. However, a property of determinants is that for any square matrix $A$, $\\text{det}(A) = \\text{det}(A^T)$. Additionally, we select the elements uniformly at random, so these matrix will have the same expected time until they reach a singular matrix. Let $O$ be the expected time to reach a singular matrix starting from $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$.

It is easy to verify that if we select any element besides the top right corner, we end up with a singular matrix in the next iteration. Therefore, with probability $\\dfrac{3}{4}$, it takes $1$ step. If we select the top right corner, we are back at the identity matrix. Therefore, $$\\mathbb{E}[O] = \\dfrac{3}{4} \\cdot 1 + \\dfrac{1}{4} \\left(1 + \\mathbb{E}[I]\\right) = 1 + \\dfrac{1}{4} \\mathbb{E}[I]$$ Plugging in the equation for $\\mathbb{E}[O]$ into the one for $\\mathbb{E}[I]$ and simplifying, $\\mathbb{E}[I] = \\dfrac{12}{7}$.",

    "task": "Two fair $6-$sided dice are rolled. You can either keep the product of the observed values or re-roll both dice once for $\\$4$. What is your expected payout on this game under a rational strategy?",
    "hint": "What is the mean value of the dice rolls? What inequality needs to be satisfied to keep your rolls? It may help to draw out a table of the possible outcomes and the products corresponding to each.",
    "solution": "If $X$ and $Y$ represent the individual die outcomes, then $XY$ is our payout. By independence of the dice rolls, $\\mathbb{E}[XY] = \\mathbb{E}[X]\\mathbb{E}[Y] = (3.5)^2 = \\dfrac{49}{4}$. If we are to re-roll, then we know the expected value of our second roll would be $\\dfrac{49}{4}$. Therefore, our strategy is to re-roll if our product is $8$ or less. This is because $8$ would be the first integer that is at least $4$ less than the mean product of the two dice, $\\dfrac{49}{4}$. The probability we obtain a product of $8$ or less is $\\dfrac{6 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1}{36} = \\dfrac{4}{9}$. We obtain these terms from looking at the ways to obtain a product at most $8$ by fixing the value of the first die. For example, if you have a $1$ on the first die, regardless of your other die value, you will have a product at most $8$, yielding $6$ combinations to our total. Therefore, we re-roll with probability $\\dfrac{4}{9}$, in which our expected value is $\\dfrac{49}{4} - 4 = \\dfrac{33}{4}$ for the re-roll. Otherwise, we keep the value of the die. If we keep the value, by drawing out a table that has all the die rolls on the axes and the products at the intersection of rows and columns, one can find that the expected value of the die roll given that it is more than $8$ is $\\dfrac{92}{5}$. Therefore, our expected value on the game is $\\dfrac{4}{9} \\cdot \\dfrac{33}{4} + \\dfrac{5}{9} \\cdot \\dfrac{92}{5} = \\dfrac{125}{9}$.",

    "solution": "We do not locate the door with $\\$1$ million exactly when the wheel does not tell us any information both times. This occurs with probability $2/5$ per trial, so the probability you don't get any information about the location of the money is $\\dfrac{2}{5} \\cdot \\dfrac{2}{5} = \\dfrac{4}{25}$.

Otherwise, with probability $\\dfrac{4}{25}$, you guess uniformly at random among the doors and locate the money with probability $\\dfrac{1}{3}$.

    "hint": "Condition on the value of the first roll. Afterwards, once you have conditioned on the value of the first roll, condition on the value of the second roll to see if it matches the first roll.",
    "solution": "We know that the value we need to not roll depends on the value we roll first. This implores us to use Law of Total Expectation and condition on the first value that we roll. Namely, if $X_1$ is our first roll and $T$ is our total, $\\mathbb{E}[T] = \\displaystyle \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{E}[T \\mid X_1]] = \\sum_{i=1}^6 \\mathbb{E}[T \\mid X_1 = i]\\mathbb{P}[X_1 = i]$.

Therefore, $\\mathbb{E}[T \\mid X_1 = i] = i + \\mathbb{E}[T' \\mid X_1 = i]$, where $T'$ is the money that is made after the first roll. We know that with probability $\\dfrac{1}{6}$, we roll the value $i$ again, and our bank is now $i$ larger than before and we are at the same game as before. Otherwise, with probability $\\dfrac{5}{6}$, we cash out next round, as we don't roll the value $i$. If we are given that we don't roll $i$ on the second die, then our expected value would be $\\dfrac{21 - i}{5}$, as the sum of the other faces is $21-i$ and each of those 5 would be equally likely if it is not the value $i$. Therefore, by Law of Total Expectation, $$\\mathbb{E}[T' \\mid X_1 = i] = \\dfrac{1}{6}\\left(i + \\mathbb{E}[T' \\mid X_1 = i]\\right) + \\dfrac{5}{6} \\cdot \\dfrac{21 - i}{5}$$ Solving this, we see that $i$ cancels and we obtain that $\\mathbb{E}[T' \\mid X_1 = i] = \\dfrac{21}{5}$ for each $i$. Adding back the first roll, $\\mathbb{E}[T \\mid X_1 = i] = i + \\dfrac{21}{5}$.

The measure of the angle between $\\theta$ and $\\phi$ is $\\theta - \\phi$. To get the length of the line segment connecting the two points, we can take a slight shortcut. The length here only depends on the distance between our points we select in terms of angle. In other words, regardless of where we end up having our points located, we can just rotate the circle so that one of them is located at $(1,0)$. Therefore, we can arbitrarily fix $\\theta_1 = 0$. Thus, the length between $\\theta_1 = 0$ and the point at $\\theta_2 = \\theta$ is $\\sqrt{(1 - \\cos(\\theta))^2 + \\sin^2(\\theta)} = \\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{1 - \\cos(\\theta)}$.

When two particles collide, both immediately change direction and continue traveling at a constant rate of one meter per second. How long will it take for all of the particles to fall off of the line on average?",
    "hint": "Before a collision, two particles are going in opposite directions towards each other. After a collision, the two particles are still going in opposite directions, but now away from each other. Thus, you can imagine switching the labels of the two particles after the collision and its as if the collision never occurred.",
    "solution": "One key feature to note is the collision property. Before a collision, two particles are going in opposite directions towards each other. After a collision, the two particles are still going in opposite directions, but now away from each other. Thus, you can imagine switching the labels of the two particles after the collision and its as if the collision never occurred. Furthermore, there is no difference with regards to which direction a particle moves in due to symmetry. A particle at the $x$-th meter will fall off of the line in $x$ seconds, on average. If it were traveling in the other direction, you can set $x$ to $1-x$. Hence, the problem is asking for the expected value of the maximum of 1000 independent and identically distributed random variables that are distributed uniformly between 0 and 1.

Namely, the cards in positions $1-26$ are now in positions $2,4,\\dots, 52$. and the cards in positions $27-52$ are now in positions $1,3,\\dots, 51$. What is the minimum number of shuffles needed before the deck returns to it's original state?",
    "hint": "If a card starts in position $x$, after $1$ shuffle, the card will now be in position $y$, where $2x \\equiv y \\hspace{3pt} (\\text{mod} \\hspace{3pt} 53)$. Can $y$ ever be $0$? Iterate this logic.",
    "solution": "If a card starts in position $x$, after $1$ shuffle, the card will now be in position $y$, where $2x \\equiv y \\hspace{3pt} (\\text{mod} \\hspace{3pt} 53)$. Note that we never obtain the value $0$ as a position, as $2$ and $53$ are relatively prime, so we can say that $1 \\leq y \\leq 52$. Therefore, after $n$ shuffles, the card in position $x$ at the beginning is now in position $w$, where $2^nx \\equiv w \\hspace{3pt} (\\text{mod} \\hspace{3pt} 53)$. By the same logic, $1 \\leq w \\leq 52$. Therefore, we need to find the smallest $n$ such that $2^nx \\equiv x \\hspace{3pt} (\\text{mod} \\hspace{3pt} 53)$. As $53$ is prime, we can invert $x$ on both sides and say that it is the smallest $n$ such that $2^n \\equiv 1 \\hspace{3pt} (\\text{mod} \\hspace{3pt} 53)$. By Fermat's Little Theorem, we know that $2^{52} \\equiv 2 \\hspace{3pt} (\\text{mod} \\hspace{3pt} 53)$, as $53$ is prime. Inverting a $2$ on both sides yields that $n = 52$ works as a solution. One can also verify this is the minimum number of shuffles needed by noting that in the group $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z},\\cdot)$, where $p$ is a prime, the order of all non-identity elements is $p-1$.

    "task": "Ty, Guy, and Psy are all flipping fair until they respectively obtain their first heads. Let $T,G,$ and $P$ represent the number of flips needed for Ty, Guy, and Psy, respectively. Find $\\mathbb{P}[T < G < P]$.",
    "hint": "What is the joint PMF of $T,G,$ and $P$ and what is the region of summation?",
    "solution": "We know that $T, G, P \\sim \\text{Geom}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)$ IID, as they are looking for the distribution of the first heads. As these are independent, we can multiply the individual PMFs to get the joint PMF, so the joint PMF is $\\mathbb{P}[T = t, G = g, P = p] = \\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)^t\\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)^g\\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)^p$ for $t,g,p = 1,2,\\dots$. We now need to get a region of summation for this probability. Let's let $t$ be free, so we sum $t$ from $1$ to $\\infty$. Then, we know $G > T$, so we sum over $g = t+1$ to $\\infty$. After that, we know $P > G$, so we sum inner most from $p = g+1$ to $\\infty$. Therefore, our sum is $\\displaystyle \\sum_{t = 1}^{\\infty} \\sum_{g = t+1}^{\\infty} \\sum_{p = g+1}^{\\infty} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)^t\\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)^g\\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)^p$. As the inner most summation only concerns $p$, we ignore the rest for now. $\\sum_{p = g+1}^{\\infty} \\dfrac{1}{2^p} = \\dfrac{\\frac{1}{2^{g+1}}}{1 - \\frac{1}{2}} = \\dfrac{1}{2^g}$. Now, our summation is $\\displaystyle \\sum_{t=1}^{\\infty} \\sum_{g = t+1}^{\\infty} \\dfrac{1}{2^t} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{2^{2g}} = \\sum_{t=1}^{\\infty} \\sum_{g = t+1}^{\\infty} \\dfrac{1}{2^{t}} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{4^g}$. Ignoring the first term, as our sum only concerns $g$, $\\displaystyle \\sum_{g=t+1}^{\\infty} \\dfrac{1}{4^g} = \\dfrac{\\frac{1}{4^{t+1}}}{1 - \\frac{1}{4}} = \\dfrac{4}{3} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{4^{t+1}}$. Now, our final summation is $\\dfrac{1}{3} \\displaystyle \\sum_{t=1}^{\\infty} \\dfrac{1}{2^t} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{4^{t}} = \\dfrac{1}{3} \\sum_{t=1}^{\\infty} \\dfrac{1}{8^t}$ after shoving the constants to the front. The last sum is simply $\\dfrac{\\frac{1}{8}}{1 - \\frac{1}{8}} = \\dfrac{1}{7}$, so our solution is $\\dfrac{1}{21}$.",

    "task": "A $3 \\times 3$ grid of light bulbs is formed. Then, each light bulb is powered on with probability $\\dfrac{1}{2}$. Find the probability that no two adjacent (grid cells that share a common side) light bulbs are powered on.",
    "hint": "First, break into cases based on the middle light bulb being on or off. Then, further consider sub-cases with the middle being off.",
    "solution": "Consider the light bulbs in a matrix arrangement as follows: $$\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3\\\\ 4 & 5 & 6\\\\ 7 & 8 & 9\\end{bmatrix}$$ There are clearly $2^9 = 512$ equally-likely outcomes of the light bulbs being activated or not. Now, we need to count the outcomes that satisfy our event. The key here is to consider light bulb $5$. If it is powered on, then none of $2,4,6,$ and $8$ can be powered on. However, $1,3,7,$ and $9$ are free to be on or off. Therefore, there are $2^4 = 16$ outcomes in this case. The other case is more complicated. Suppose that light bulb $5$ is off now. We now have $4$ sub-cases to consider corresponding to the different combinations of when light bulbs $4$ and $6$ are powered or not. $\\textbf{Case 1 - Both On:}$ In this case, $1,3,7,$ and $9$ all must be off. However, $2$ and $8$ are free to be on or off, so there are $2^2 = 4$ outcomes in this case. $\\textbf{Case 2 - One On:}$ To simplify, we will consider when $4$ is on and $6$ is off. Then, we can just multiply by $2$ to account for the other case. Since $4$ is on, $1$ and $7$ must be off. For $2$ and $3$, either exactly one is on or neither is on. This accounts for $3$ cases. This holds similarly for light bulbs $8$ and $9$, so there are $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 = 18$ combinations in this case. $\\textbf{Case 3 - Both Off:}$ If both $4$ and $6$ are off, then light bulbs $1-3$ can either be all off ($1$ case), have exactly one on ($3$ cases), or have $1$ and $3$ on with $2$ off ($1$ case). This yields $5$ total cases. This similarly holds for lightbulbs $7-9$, so there are $5^2 = 25$ combinations for this case. Adding all of these up, we get that there are $16 + 4 + 18 + 25 = 63$ total combinations that are favorable, so our answer is $\\dfrac{63}{512}$.",

The second leg is expected to be $\\frac{1}{4}^{\\text{th}}$ of the circumference away from the initial leg (draw out the circle, you will see that the average spot for the second leg is half way between where the first leg is and the opposite point of the first leg).

    "solution": "We will use the fact that for a (non-circular) symmetric random walk starting at $0$ with boundaries $a$ and $-b$, for $a,b > 0$ being integers, the expected time to hit a boundary is $ab$. This is a fairly well-known fact and is a good exercise to prove if you have never done so before. Imagine we flattened out the circle into a line. In this case, to hit $0$ from $1$, we either need to move $1$ unit up or $99$ units down (this would get us to $0$ by hitting spot $99$ and circling back to $0$). The answer is immediate from this fact. Namely, if we treat $1$ as our starting point i.e. $0$, we can treat the boundaries as $1$ and $-99$, so our answer is just $99$ by the lemma above.",

    "task": "Michael is taking his remote control skateboard around campus. Assume the front of the Hopkins sign is the origin $(0,0)$, and that movement to the right is positive horizontally, and movement into campus (upwards) is positive vertically. Each second, Michael chooses a uniformly random angle between $0$ and $2\\pi$, and then moves his skateboard a distance of 1 foot at that angle from the skateboards previous position. After $16$ seconds, what is the expected squared distance Michael's skateboard is away from the Hopkins sign?",
    "hint": "Define a distance variable and write it as the sum of $16$ IID random variables.",
    "solution": "We know that we select an angle uniformly at random and then we move $1$ unit in that direction. Thus, we have that after $n$ movements, if $\\theta_1,\\dots, \\theta_n$ are the angles selected, $X = \\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^n \\cos(\\theta_i)$ and $Y = \\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sin(\\theta_i)$, where each of the $\\theta_i$ are IID Unif$(0,2\\pi)$ random variables. Thus, the expected squared distance from the origin is just $$D^2 = X^2 + Y^2 = \\displaystyle \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\cos(\\theta_i)\\right)^2 + \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\sin(\\theta_i)\\right)^2 $$ Next, we can expand out each of the summations to get that the above is $\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^n \\cos^2(\\theta_i) + \\sum_{i\\ \\neq j} \\cos(\\theta_i)\\cos(\\theta_j) + \\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sin^2(\\theta_i) + \\sum_{i \\neq j} \\sin(\\theta_i)\\sin(\\theta_j).$ Grouping the terms together nicely, we get that the above is $$\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(\\cos^2(\\theta_i) + \\sin^2(\\theta_i)\\right) + \\displaystyle \\sum_{i \\neq j} \\left(\\cos(\\theta_i)\\cos(\\theta_j) + \\sin(\\theta_i)\\sin(\\theta_j)\\right)$$ The first sum evaluates to just $n$ by trigonometric identities. The second has an interior equal to $\\cos(\\theta_i - \\theta_j)$. Thus, we have that $D^2 = n + \\displaystyle \\sum_{i \\neq j} \\cos(\\theta_i - \\theta_j)$. Therefore, the expectation $\\mathbb{E}[D^2] = n + \\displaystyle \\sum_{i\\neq j} \\mathbb{E}[\\cos(\\theta_i - \\theta_j)]$. Computing this expectation is quite simple. The joint PDF of $\\theta_i$ and $\\theta_j$ is given by $f(\\theta_i,\\theta_j) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi^2}I_{(0,2\\pi)}(\\theta_i)I_{(0,2\\pi)}(\\theta_j)$, so this expectation is given by $\\displaystyle \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\dfrac{\\cos(\\theta_i - \\theta_j)}{4\\pi^2}d\\theta_id\\theta_j$. The first integral evaluates to $\\displaystyle \\int_0^{2\\pi} -\\dfrac{1}{4\\pi^2}\\left(\\sin(2\\pi-\\theta_j) - \\sin(-\\theta_j)\\right)d\\theta_j = 0$, as $\\sin(-\\theta_j) = \\sin(2\\pi - \\theta_j)$ by periodicity. Thus, the expectation is just $n$. Alternatively, you could see that since $\\theta$ ranges over $(0,2\\pi)$, the mean of the cosine and sine on those intervals is $0$, so that can go quicker. Our specific case here is $n = 16$, so $16$ is our answer.",

The lengths of the three pieces would then by given by $X, Y - X,$ and $1 - Y$. Thus, we want $\\mathbb{P}[\\text{min}(X,Y-X,1-Y) < 0.05] = 1 - \\mathbb{P}[\\text{min}(X,Y-X,1-Y) > 0.05]$. By properties of the minimum, this is the same as $1 - \\mathbb{P}[X > 0.05, Y > X + 0.05, Y < 0.95]$. The last two terms are obtained by rearranging the inequalities. Drawing the region where all three of those conditions are true out in the plane yields a triangular region. Since the slope is one, the two legs are of the same length. Note that $X > 0.05$ and $Y < 0.95$. Thus, we have that the endpoint of where we leave our region of interest is $X = 0.9$, as then $Y = 0.95$. Thus, the length of each leg is $\\dfrac{17}{20}$, so the area of the triangle is just $\\dfrac{1}{2}\\left(\\dfrac{17}{20}\\right)^2 = \\dfrac{289}{800}$.

    "task": "There are $12$ beans; one weighs slightly heavier or lighter than the others. What is the minimum number of times a balance scale must be used to guarantee the determination of the abnormal bean?",
    "hint": "Start the same way we do for \"Balanced Beans\".",
    "solution": "The first step is similar to the other \"Balanced Beans\" problem and its to split the beans into $3$ groups of four. Put one group on one side and another group on the other side, leaving one group unweighted. The best case scenario is if the scale is balanced on both sides which means the abnormal bean is in the unweighted group. In this case, you can take two beans from that group and weigh them on either side. If the scale is balanced, you know the abnormal bean is one of the other two beans in the $3^{\\text{rd}}$ group. Thus you can pick one of these two beans and replace either side with that bean. If the scale continues to stay balanced, you know the last bean (never touched the scale) is the abnormal one. Otherwise, its the new bean you put on the scale. Its a similar approach if the scales are not balanced after you selected two beans from the $3^{\\text{rd}}$ group. You replace one side with a bean you know is normal and if it continues to remain unbalanced, the bean that stayed on the scale is abnormal. Otherwise its the bean you replaced with a normal bean. Now lets cover the more difficult situation where the two groups of four aren't balanced. The key realization with this problem is to move around subsets of each group, specifically subsets of three beans. Lets call the two groups of four on the scale Group 1 (left side) and Group 2 (right side) while the unweighted group is Group 3. We take three beans from Group 1 and move them to Group 2, take three beans from Group 2 and move them to Group 3, and three beans from Group 3 and move them to Group 1. Now the best case scenario is the balance doesn't change its orientation (if the left side was lighter before the moving of groups of three, it continues to stay lighter). This is the best case scenario because we know the abnormal bean is either the bean that didn't move from from Group 1 or the bean that didn't move from Group 2. We can easily deduce which one is the abnormal one by weighing one of these beans against a known normal bean and deduce if the bean weighed is the normal or abnormal bean. Lets say the scale does change orientation after the $2^{\\text{nd}}$ weighing. If the scale flips orientations (still unbalanced but not the same side being lighter than the other), then we know the abnormal bean was in the group of three beans we moved from Group 1 to Group 2. We would also know if this bean is lighter or heavier than the others. If the left side (Group 1) weighed more than the right (Group 2), and it flipped to the right weighing more, then we know the abnormal bean weighs more than the others. Same thing if its lighter but we'd notice the left side going from being lighter to heavier. Weigh any two beans from this group of three that's currently in Group 2 to deduce the abnormal bean. Lets go back to the case where the scales were originally unbalanced but after the 2nd weighing, the becomes balanced. This means that the abnormal bean is in the group of three we moved from Group 2 to Group 3. We would also know if this bean is heavier or lighter than the others as we could remember if the right side (Group 2) was up or down after the second weighing. Now weigh any two beans from this group of three to deduce the abnormal bean. The total number of $3$ weightings needed to guarantee you know which bean is the abnormal one.",

Plugging everything in, $$dX_t = -\\dfrac{1}{Y_t^2} \\cdot Y_t(2dt - dW_t) + \\dfrac{1}{Y_t^3} \\cdot Y_t^2 dt = \\dfrac{1}{Y_t}\\left(-dt + dW_t\\right) = X_t(-dt + dW_t)$$ This yields that our answer is $-1 \\cdot 1 = -1$.",

These four positions can be filled with any of the combination of the eight students, since each combination has one possible arrangement that follows the height invariant. The remaining four students that are not chosen must go to the other side of the line, of which there is only one arrangement to satisfy the height invariant.

Usually, on a chain, when the strike of our call option increases, the call option's value approaches full value, meaning the difference between our prices should be close to the difference in our strike prices. In this example, as our call option increases in strike price, we would expect the prices to get increasingly farther away. In this case, the prices actually start converging, showing our chain is improperly formed. The same is true on the put side, we should see the difference in price increase as the strike price decreases, but again, the opposite is true. In order to take advantage of this, we can use an iron condor strategy. Usually an iron condor is used to take advantage of a neutral market, but in this case, we just care about the large mispricings in the chain.

By the Central Limit Theorem, they are also approximately normally distributed, as they are defined as the sum of a large number of IID random variables. All that remains is to find the mean and variance. We do this for $S_{324}$, but as they are IID, these apply to $T_{324}$ too.

Therefore, $S_{324}$ and $T_{324}$ are each well-approximated by independent $N(108,18)$ random variables.

Since the votes are thrown in the box randomly, the probability any given vote draw is for Candidate $A$ is $\\dfrac{n}{m+n}$, while it is $\\dfrac{m}{m+n}$ for Candidate $B$. Conditioning on which candidate has the last vote, we get that $$Q(n,m) = Q(n-1,m) \\cdot \\dfrac{n}{m+n} + Q(n,m-1) \\cdot \\dfrac{m}{m+n}$$ This is because of the fact that the probability that $A$ is never behind in all $n$ draws is the same as the probability that $A$ is not behind if they received $n-1$ votes and $B$ received $m$ votes, which is $Q(n-1,m)$. By the same argument, we get that the probability $A$ is never behind with the last vote being for $B$ is the same as if $A$ is never behind given $A$ had $n$ votes and $B$ had $m-1$ votes. Our goal is now find $Q(n,m)$. A good warm-up is to consider an edge case of when $A$ has $n > 1$ votes and $B$ has $m = 1$ votes. $A$ would never be behind exactly when the singular $B$ vote is not the first one drawn. The probability of this is $\\dfrac{n}{n+1}$. This suggests to us to consider $\\dfrac{n}{n+m}$ for a general $m$. To prove this, we induct on the value of $n+m$. If $n + m = 1$, this means $n = 1$ and $m = 0$. In this case, $Q(1,0) = \\dfrac{1}{1+0} = 1$, which is accurate. More generally, suppose this holds for when $n+m = k$ for all $1 \\leq k \\leq r$. We now need to show it holds for $n + m = r+1$. Using our recurrence, $$Q(n,m) = \\dfrac{n}{m+n} \\cdot Q(n-1,m) + \\dfrac{m}{m+n} \\cdot Q(n,m-1) = \\dfrac{n}{m+n} \\cdot \\dfrac{n-1}{n-1+m} + \\dfrac{m}{m+n} \\cdot \\dfrac{n}{n+(m-1)} = \\dfrac{n}{n+m}$$ We can use our recurrence relation here since if $n+m = r+1$, $n+(m-1) = (n-1)+m = r$, so the induction hypothesis applies. For our particular case, the answer is $\\dfrac{100}{100+80} =\\dfrac{5}{9}$",

Instead, two of the indicators will correspond to a $10 \\times 20$ side, two to a $20 \\times 30$ side, and two to a $10 \\times 30$ side. Therefore, there are 3 subsets of indicators that are exchangeable, so we can reduce it to an expectation involving 3 indicators and multiply it by 2, so $\\mathbb{E}[T] = 2(\\mathbb{E}[I_1] + \\mathbb{E}[I_2] + \\mathbb{E}[I_3])$, where we take $I_1$ to indicate a $10 \\times 20$ side, $I_2$ to indicate a $20 \\times 30$ side, and $I_3$ to indicate a $10 \\times 30$ side.

For $I_2$, that is $20 \\cdot 30 = 600$ cubes. For $I_3$, that is $10 \\cdot 30 = 300$ cubes. All of these need to be divided by $6000$ as that is the volume of the entire prism.

If the first $M$ is $0$, then the first day must be $1$ or $2$ OR the day is $31$ ($30$ doesn't work since we already have a $0$. If the first $M$ is $1$, then either the second $M$ is a $0$ OR the second $M$ is a $2$ and the day contains a $0$ somewhere. Therefore, these both imply that the $0$ and either the $1$ or $2$ must be used in the $MMDD$ portion. Since we ideally don't want to skip $1000$ years, we should put the $2$ in the year portion, so thus far, we have that our date is in the form $$0M/1D/2YYY$$ After this, it's just an objective to minimize the rest of the digits. Namely, $YYY = 345$, as that is the smallest number that can be made with the remaining digits. Then, we want to minimize the month, so $M = 6$. Then, lastly, $D = 7$, as that is the smallest remaining number. Our answer is therefore $$06/17/2345$$",

Then $\\mathbb{P}[E] = \\displaystyle \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\mathbb{P}[N = 2k]$, as we want an even amount of flips needed. Let's find the term inside. The event $\\{N = 2k\\}$ means that the last two flips must be either $HH$ or $TT$. However, once we select the last two flips, the other $2k-2$ flips must be fixed. Namely, they must alternate between $H$ and $T$, with the starting flip based on which ending we have. For example, if $\\{N = 4\\}$ this correspond to the two sequences $THTT$ and $HTHH$. Therefore, of the $2^{2k}$ possible sequences of length $k$, exactly $2$ satisfy our event, so $\\mathbb{P}[T = 2k] = \\dfrac{2}{2^{2k}} = \\dfrac{2}{4^k}$.

    "hint": "Consider an ordering of $52$ cards. In order for Aaron to win a prize, (1) the $k$-th card must be an ace, (2) there must be exactly two aces in the first $k-1$ cards, and (3) there must be exactly one ace in the last $52-k$ cards.",

Treating all cards as distinguishable, we find the following function of $k$ that describes the probability that Aaron wins a prize. \\[\\begin{aligned} \\mathbb{P}(\\text{Aaron wins}) &= \\frac{\\binom{k-1}{2} \\binom{52-k}{1} 4! 48!}{52!} \\\\ &= \\frac{12 \\cdot 48! \\cdot (52 - k)(k - 1)(k - 2)}{52!} \\end{aligned}\\] We arrive at the above expression as follows: (1) choose two cards to assign as aces from the first $k-1$ cards, (2) assign the $k$-th card as an ace, (3) choose one card to assign as an ace from last $52 - k$ cards, and finally, (3) there are $4!$ ways to order the four distinguishable aces among the four allotted ace slots.

Suppose that it started with a $2$. We know that the first $M$ is either a $0$ or $1$. If it is a $0$, then the day either starts with a $1$ or is $31$. Note that the other $M$ can't be a $1$ in this case. Otherwise, that would eliminate the day possibilities. If the month starts with a $1$, then the day either contains $0$ or is $30$. However, since the $0$ is taken already in the $MMDD$ part, regardless of what we start with, we can't get a year that is in the past. Therefore, the year must start with a $1$. To maximize the year, we can just fix the rest as the three largest integers. Namely, $987$, so our year is $1987$. Since the year starts with $1$, the month must start with $0$. Then, we choose the largest month integer remaining, which is $6$. Then, we must pick the largest possible day among the integers remaining. We can see that $25$ is the largest possible day, as anything starting with $3$ is not possible. Therefore, our date is $$06/25/1987$$",

    "solution": "We can first make some simplifications to the game. Firstly, if the strategy is optimal, then if this game were to be repeated many times, they would not change their strategy. Therefore, the optimal strategy for the game where there are $2$ consecutive marble draws is the same as the optimal strategy for the game with one draw. Then, we just multiply the expected profit by $2$ to represent the two draws. Furthermore, as this game is symmetric for the two players, their optimal strategy will be the same. This point will be important later. Let $A(a,b)$ be the expected profit that $A$ obtains with player $A$ putting in $a$ balls and $B$ putting in $b$ balls. Namely, for the one draw game, $$A(a,b) = \\dfrac{a}{a+b} \\cdot (100 - a)$$ As player $a$ draws his ball with probability $\\dfrac{a}{a+b}$ and $100-a$ is the payout. Let's fix $b$ and find the $a$ that is the best response to this $b$. In other words, given $b$, what $a$ optimizes $A(a,b)$? To do this, we take the partial derivative of $A(a,b)$ in $a$ and treat $a$ as continuous for now. We will then account for discreteness at the end. This yields that $$\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial a}A(a,b) = -\\dfrac{a^2 + 2ba - 100b}{(a+b)^2} = 0 \\iff a^2 + 2ba - 100b = 0$$ Solving the above with the quadratic equation yields that $a^* = \\dfrac{-2b \\pm \\sqrt{4b^2 + 400b}}{2}$. However, the $-$ root results in a negative value, so $a^* = \\sqrt{b^2 + 100b} - b$ is the best response for player $A$ if player $B$ puts $b$ marbles in. Similarly, as this game is symmetric, the optimal response for player $B$ if player $A$ puts $a$ marbles in is $b^* = \\sqrt{a^2 - 100a} - a$. To find the optimal strategy for each player, this means that we need to find the combo $(a^*,b^*)$ such that neither of the players can do better by adjusting their strategy. We already are aware from before that $a^* = b^*$ by the symmetry of the game. Therefore, to solve for this, we just substitute in $b$ as $b^* = a^*$ in the first equation. This yields we can say that $$a^* = \\sqrt{(a^*)^2 + 100a^*} - a^* \\iff 4(a^*)^2 = (a^*)^2 + 100a^* \\iff a^*(3a^* - 100) = 0 \\iff a^* = 0,\\dfrac{100}{3}$$ As $0$ is not possible, we conclude that $a^* = b^* = \\dfrac{100}{3}$ is the optimal strategy. However, this is not actually possible, as our marbles must be an integer value. Therefore, we should test $(33,33)$ and $(34,34)$ to see if they are Nash equilibria. For $(33,33)$, the expected payout for one draw for each player is $\\dfrac{67}{2}$. One can check that by varying $a$ and keeping $b$ fixed at $33$, player $A$ can't do any better. Therefore, $(33,33)$ is a Nash equilibrium. For $(34,34)$, the expected payout is $33$. However, one can also verify that the expected payout for $(33,34)$ is also $33$. However, this can't be an equilibrium, as $b$ should change to $33$ marbles to yield higher expected payout. Thus, while $(34,34)$ is also a Nash equilibrium, $(33,33)$ is preferrable because of the higher expected payout. This means that the optimal strategy is for both players to place $33$ marbles and have a total expected payout of $\\dfrac{67}{2} \\cdot 2 = 67$.",

    "solution": "From the above, we know that $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 100$ by the constraint of having $100$ animals. We also know that $50x_1 + 10x_2 + 0.5x_3 = 1000$ by the constraint of spending $1000$ total. Subtracting half of the first equation from the second yields that $49.5x_1 + 9.5x_2 = 900$, or equivalently that $99x_1 + 19x_2 = 1900$. We need to solve this in the integers that stay within our constraints of each $0 \\leq x_i \\leq 100$. The easiest solution is to note that $99 \\cdot 19 = (100 - 1) \\cdot 19 = 1900 - 19$. Therefore, $x_1 = 19$ and $x_2 = 1$ is a solution to this. We leave out verification that it is the only solution satisfying our constraints. This implies now that $x_3 = 100 - 19 - 1 = 80$. Therefore, $x_1x_2x_3 = 19 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 80 = 1520$.",

    "hint": "The complement is that everyone is born on a distinct day of the week.",
    "solution": "Instead of trying to compute the probability that at least two people are born on the same day, it is easier to work with the complement, which is that everyone is born on a distinct day of the week. Then, all we need to do is subtract this probability from $1$ to get the probability of the event we are interested in. The first friend has all $7$ days of the week available to them. The second has $6$ options since one is taken by the first friend. The last has $5$ days to select from, so the number of ways to pick the days of the week the people are born on with all days distinct is $7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5$. The total number of days to pick with no restriction is $7^3$. Therefore, the probability all days are distinct is $\\dfrac{7\\cdot 6 \\cdot 5}{7^3} = \\dfrac{30}{49}$. Therefore, the probability that at least two of the people share a birthday is $1 - \\dfrac{30}{49} = \\dfrac{19}{49}$.",

    "solution": "Let $S(n)$ be the sum of the digits of an integer $n$. The difference between any integer $n$ and $S(n)$ is divisible by $9$ i.e. $9 \\mid n - S(n)$ for any integer $n$. Let $x$ be the missing digit. Then we know that as there are $9$ digits and one is missing, the sum of all the digits in $2^{29}$ is $45 - x$. Plugging this in, $9 \\mid 2^{29} - (45 - x)$. Now, note that $2^{29} = 2^5 \\cdot (2^6)^4 = 2^5 \\cdot 64^4 = 2^5 \\cdot (63 + 1)^4$ by basic rearrangement. By the Binomial Theorem, every single term in $(63+1)^4$ is divisible by $63$ except the last term, which is $1$. Therefore, we can write $(63+1)^4 = 63k + 1$ for some integer $k$. Substituting this back in, we get that $$2^{29} = 2^5 \\cdot (63k + 1) = 63 \\cdot 2^5 \\cdot k + 2^5$$ Subtracting $2^5$, we have that $2^{29} - 2^5 = 63 \\cdot 2^5 \\cdot k$. This means that $9 \\mid 2^{29} - 2^5$. Using this fact, as we know $9 \\mid 2^{29} - (45- x)$ and $9 \\mid 2^{29} - 2^5$, we know that $9 \\mid 2^5 - (45 - x)$, as we just subtracted two values divisible by $9$. This means that $9 \\mid x - 13$. As $x$ is a digit, it must be between $0$ and $9$, inclusive of both.

    "hint": "Graph shading is a powerful technique that will be useful for this problem. Start by writing your constraints. Because each segment is equally likely to be the longest, the expected length of the longest piece doesn't depend on which piece we choose, so you are solving for $E[X \\vert X \\textrm{ is the longest}]$.",
    "solution": "Let $X \\in [0,1]$ be the location of the first cut and $Y \\in [0,1]$ be the location of the second cut such that $X&ltY$. Because each segment is equally likely to be the longest, the expected length of the longest piece doesn't depend on which piece we choose, so we can solve for $E[X \\vert X \\textrm{ is the longest}]$. This, with our earlier constraint of $X&ltY$, gives us two additional constraints: $$ X > Y-X \\Rightarrow Y < 2X$$ $$ X > 1-Y \\Rightarrow Y > 1-X$$ These two constraints derive from the fact that $X$ is given to be greater than the other two segments, $Y-X$ and $1-Y$. Graphing the constraints within our sample space, we see that the area satisfying our inequalities is the triangle A with vertices $(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}), (\\frac{1}{2},1)$, and $(\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{2}{3})$, and triangle B with vertices $(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}), (\\frac{1}{2},1)$, and $(1, 1)$. We wish to find the probability of an outcome occurring in either areas and the expected value of X within each area. $$\\textrm{Area of A: }\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times (\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{3}) = \\frac{1}{24}$$ $$\\textrm{Area of B: }\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{8} =\\frac{3}{24} = 3 \\times \\textrm{Area of A}$$ $$\\textrm{Expected value of X within A: } \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{3}(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{3}) = \\frac{4}{9}$$ $$\\textrm{Expected value of X within B: } \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{2}{3}$$ The expected value of X within each triangle is calculated using the property of centroids. A centroid, or the center of area for a triangle, is $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the way from the base to the opposite vertex, a property that is most easily seen by integration. Finally, we can solve for the expected value of X given X is the longest piece: $$E[X \\vert X \\textrm{ is the longest}] = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{4}{9} + \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{11}{18}$$",

    "task": "Clarence is getting this bread. Literally. Clarence has 7 small loaves and 3 large loaves of bread in a bag. He draws in his bag and pulls out a loaf of bread uniformly at random, one-by-one. If it is a small loaf, Clarence eats it. If it is a large loaf, Clarence cuts it into two small loaves. He eats one one of them and puts the other one back in the bag. Find the expected number of small loaves that Clarence eats until the bag contains only small loaves left, inclusive of the small loaf he eats as a result of the last large loaf he draws.",
    "hint": "Use the \"First Ace\" approach three separate times on the first appearances of the next large loaf after previous ones have been eaten.",
    "solution": "Here, we are looking for the expected number of draws needed until Clarence grabs all $3$ large loaves of bread from the bag. Since we are doing this drawing without replacement, this implies we should implement some type of \"First Ace\" approach. However, the issue here is that when Clarence draws a large loaf, he replaces it by another small loaf. Therefore, this isn't exactly like the paradigm above, as when you draw an Ace, it is not replaced in any way. Our new strategy is to thus consider the expected number of draws needed to see each consecutive large loaf. First, let's find the number of loaves Clarence eats until (and including) his first selection of a large loaf. There are $3$ large loaves and $7$ small loaves. Therefore, we can treat the large loaves as our \"dividers\" and the $7$ small as filler between them. The loaves split up our drawing process into $4$ equally-sized components (in expectation). Therefore, we expect $\\dfrac{7}{4}$ small loaves before the first large loaf. Afterwards, Clarence eats one of the two small loaves that results from the large loaf and then replaces the other in the bag. Therefore, he has eaten a total of $\\dfrac{7}{4} + 1 = \\dfrac{11}{4}$ loaves thus far. Additionally, there are $\\dfrac{7}{4} - 1 = \\dfrac{3}{4}$ fewer small loaves in the bag on average. Now, we apply the same paradigm again but on $7 - \\dfrac{3}{4} = \\dfrac{25}{4}$ small loaves and $2$ large loaves. We get $3$ equally-sized regions in expectation from the two large loaves, so there should be $\\dfrac{25}{12}$ small loaves coming before the next large loaf. Therefore, Clarence eats $\\dfrac{25}{12} + 1 = \\dfrac{37}{12}$ small loaves on average between the first and second large loaf selection. This brings our total thus far to $\\dfrac{11}{4} + \\dfrac{37}{12} = \\dfrac{35}{6}$. With one large loaf left and an (on average) $\\dfrac{25}{4} - \\dfrac{13}{12} = \\dfrac{31}{6}$ small loaves left, we would expect half of those small loaves to come before the large loaf. Therefore, we expect Clarence to eat $\\dfrac{31}{12} + 1 = \\dfrac{43}{12}$ more large loaves until completion. This yields that Clarence would need to eat an expected number of $\\dfrac{35}{6} + \\dfrac{43}{12} = \\dfrac{113}{12}$ small loaves total.",

If there a zero in the interval $(0,1)$ AKA some $x^* \\in (0,1)$ such that $f(x^*) = 0$, then we must have that $f(0) $ and $f(1)$ are of opposite signs. This is by the intermediate value theorem. One can show that $\\mathbb{P}[f(x) \\hspace{3pt} \\text{is strictly increasing}] = 1$ by taking the derivative and noting it is always positive for $x \\in (0,1)$. We have that $f(0) = -c$ and $f(1) = M+N - c$. We know that since $M, N \\sim \\text{Unif}(0,1)$, they are both positive values. They only take values between $0$ and $1$ individually. For $0 < c < 2$, we have that $f(0) = -c < 0$ and $f(1) = M+N - c$. If we want $f(1) > 0$, then $M+N - c > 0$, so $M+N > c$. Thus, we want the value $\\mathbb{P}[M+N > c]$. However, this is easier stated as $1 - \\mathbb{P}[M+N \\leq c]$. This is essentially asking for the CDF of $M+N$. Using convolution (or any other method you prefer), you get that the PDF $M+N$ is given by $$f(z) = zI_{(0,1)}(z) + (2-z)I_{[1,2)}(z)$$ To find the CDF, we need to actually split up into cases of $0 < c < 1$ and $1 \\leq c < 2$, as the PDF splits there. For $0 < c < 1$, this is just the integral $$\\displaystyle \\int_0^c z dz = \\dfrac{c^2}{2}$$ as we are solely on the first branch of that indicator with $0 < c < 1$. If $1 \\leq c < 2$, we can write this integral as $$\\displaystyle \\int_0^c f(z)dz = \\int_0^1 f(z)dz + \\int_1^c f(z)dz$$ The first integral evaluates to our previous expression evaluated at $1$, which is just $\\dfrac{1}{2}$, and our second becomes the integral $\\displaystyle \\int_1^c (2-z)dz = \\left(2z - \\dfrac{z^2}{2}\\right)\\Big|_1^c = 2c - \\dfrac{c^2}{2} - \\dfrac{3}{2}$.

What is the probability that Frank makes exactly 50 free throws in 100 attempts?",
    "hint": "Work out $n = 3,4,5$ and notice a pattern",
    "solution": "Consider $n = 3$. There are two possible outcomes: Frank makes 2 total free throws, or Frank makes 1 total free throw. Each occurs with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$. Next, consider $n = 4$. If Frank makes 3 total free throws, then he must have made every free throw beginning with $n = 3$. This occurs with probability $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}$. If Frank makes 2 total free throws, then he either misses the 3rd free thrown or the 4th free throw, which occurs with probability $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}$. If Frank makes 1 total free throw, then he must have missed both the 3rd and 4th free throws, which occurs with probability $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}$. We are already starting to see a pattern here, but we'll keep going for $n = 5$ just to confirm our suspicions. If Frank makes 4 total free throws, then he must have made every free throw beginning with $n = 3$, which occurs with probability $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{1}{4}$. If Frank makes 3 total free throws, then he misses on either the 3rd, 4th, or 5th attempt, which occurs with probability $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{2}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{4}$. Similarly, if Frank makes 2 total free throws, then he makes it on either the 3rd, 4th, or 5th attempt, which occurs with probability $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{2}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{4}$. If Frank makes 1 total free throw, then he must have missed every attempt beginning with $n = 3$, which occurs with probability $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{1}{4}$. Following this pattern, we see that the probability of achieving any number of throws on by the $n$-th attempt is just $\\frac{1}{n-1}$. So our solution for this problem is $\\frac{1}{99}$",

    "solution": "Let $T$ be the total number of coin flips needed and $X$ be the total number of heads that appear on the first flipping of the coins. Then $\\mathbb{E}[T] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{E}[T \\mid X]] = \\sum_{k=0}^{4}\\mathbb{E}[T \\mid X =k]\\mathbb{P}[X = k]$ by Law of Total Expectation. $X \\sim \\text{Binom}\\left(4,\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)$ because $X$ counts the number of heads appearing in $4$ flips of a fair coin. To set our notation, let $e_i$ represent the additional number of flips needed to stop our process once we have $i$ heads. If $X = 4$, then obviously we don't flip any coins again, so $\\mathbb{E}[T \\mid X = 4] = 4$. This would mean $e_4 = 0$. If $X = 3$, then we would be consider one heads and one tails. We should turn over the tails so that we have a guaranteed head i.e. we end up with either $3$ or $4$ heads after this process. Then, with equal probability, we would get a heads or tails on the remaining coin, so $e_3 = 2 + \\dfrac{1}{2}e_3 + \\dfrac{1}{2}e_4$. Putting in $e_4 = 0$ yields that $e_3 = 4$. This means $\\mathbb{E}[T \\mid X = 3] = 8$. If $X = 2$, then we are considering $2$ tails, meaning we turn one over and flip the other. This is exactly the same scenario as above, as we are guaranteed to have $3$ or $4$ heads after with the same probabilities, so $e_2 = 4$ as well. This means $\\mathbb{E}[T \\mid X = 2] = 8$. If $X = 1$, then we consider $2$ tails. We turn one over, and then we flip the other. We will end with either $2$ or $3$ heads after this iteration with equal probability. Therefore, $e_1 = 2 + \\dfrac{1}{2}e_2 + \\dfrac{1}{2}e_3$. As $e_2 = e_3 = 4$, $e_1 = 6$. This means $\\mathbb{E}[T \\mid X = 1] = 10$. Lastly, if $X = 0$, we just consider $2$ tails one again. We turn one over, and then we flip the other. We will end with either $1$ or $2$ heads after this iteration with equal probability, so $e_0 = 2 + \\dfrac{1}{2}e_1 + \\dfrac{1}{2}e_2$.

Therefore, the PMFs of the sums of independent $6-$sided and $8-$sided dice are symmetric about their means. Namely, $S_m$ has a symmetric PMF about $3.5m$ and $T_n$ has a symmetric PMF about $4.5n$. Therefore, if we can find values of $m$ and $n$ such that the means are the same, both sums will be symmetric about the means, and the condition in the question will be satisfied. This means we must find the smallest $m$ and $n$ satisfying $3.5m = 4.5n$. These would be the same as the smallest $m$ and $n$ such that $7m = 9n$ by multiplication of $2$ on both sides. As $7$ and $9$ are relatively prime, the smallest integer solution is $m^* = 9$ and $n^* = 7$, so $m^*n^* = 63$.",

Therefore, plugging this and expanding out the two terms, we have $$\\dfrac{1}{2} + \\dfrac{1}{4}\\sum_{k=2}^{\\infty} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{k-1} - \\dfrac{1}{k+1}\\right) - \\dfrac{1}{2} \\sum_{k=2}^{\\infty} \\dfrac{1}{k^2}$$ The first sum telescopes to $1 + \\dfrac{1}{2} = \\dfrac{3}{2}$, as the remaining terms cancel. The term telescopes since the subtracted term lags behind by $2$, so only the $k = 2$ and $k = 3$ terms are counted. Then, the second term is close to the known sum $$\\displaystyle \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\dfrac{1}{k^2} = \\dfrac{\\pi^2}{6}$$ The only difference is the $k = 1$ term is missing. Therefore, the sum in our question evaluates to $\\dfrac{\\pi^2}{6} - 1$, as we add and subtract the $k = 1$ term. Plugging in everything, our probability is $$\\dfrac{1}{2} + \\dfrac{1}{4} \\cdot \\dfrac{3}{2} - \\dfrac{1}{2} \\cdot \\left(\\dfrac{\\pi^2}{6} - 1\\right) = \\dfrac{11}{8} - \\dfrac{\\pi^2}{12}$$ Therefore, $a = 12$ and $q = \\dfrac{11}{8}$, so $aq = \\dfrac{33}{2}$.",

    "task": "Two players, say $A$ and $B$, play the following game: Both players have $100$ marbles and may put anywhere between $1$ and $100$ marbles in the box each. This decision is not revealed to the other player. Then, they draw $1$ marble. If the marble belongs to $A$, then assuming that $A$ put $a$ marbles in the box, $A$ is paid $100-a$ monetary units from player $B$. Similarly if the marble belongs to $B$, then assuming $B$ put $b$ marbles in the box, $B$ is paid $100-b$ monetary units from player $A$. Assume both players play optimally. How many marbles should player $A$ select?",
    "hint": "Set up a function $A(a,b)$ the represents the expected payout if $A$ puts in $a$ marbles and $b$ puts in $b$ marbles. Find the equilibrium.",
    "solution": "Similar to Optimal Marbles I, this game is symmetric for the two players, so their optimal strategy will be the same. This point will be important later. One main difference is that this is a zero-sum game, unlike Optimal Marbles I. The function we have to optimize will be significantly different. Let $A(a,b)$ be the expected profit/loss of player $A$ when $A$ puts in $a$ marbles and $B$ puts in $b$ marbles. Then $$A(a,b) = \\dfrac{a}{a+b}\\cdot (100 - b) - \\dfrac{b}{a+b} \\cdot (100 - b)$$ because $a$ wins with probability $\\dfrac{a}{a+b}$ and $b$ wins with probability $\\dfrac{b}{a+b}$. We want to optimize $A(a,b)$ for $a$ when $b$ is a fixed value. Therefore, we are going to take the derivative of $A(a,b)$ (treating $A(a,b)$ as continuous in its arguments) with respect to $a$ and try to optimize that. Taking the derivative, we get $$\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial a} A(a,b) = -\\dfrac{a^2 + 2ba + b^2 - 200b}{(a+b)^2} = 0 \\iff a^2 + 2ba + b^2 - 200b = 0 \\iff a^* = \\dfrac{-2b \\pm \\sqrt{4b^2 - 4b^2 + 800b}}{2}$$ However, note that the root involving subtraction of the square root would be negative, so we must add our square root instead. Simplifying, we get $a^* = 10\\sqrt{2b} - b$. As the game is symmetric, $b^* = 10\\sqrt{2a} - a$. To find the optimal strategy, we must solve for when $a^* = b^*$. In other words, we let $b$ in the equation for $a^*$ be $b^* = a^*$. This means that $$a^* = 10\\sqrt{2a^*} - a^* \\iff 4(a^*)^2 = 200a^* \\iff a^* = 0,50$$ Once again, as $a^* > 0$, we must have $a^* = b^* = 50$, which means $(50,50)$ is our Nash equilibrium. Therefore, player $A$ should place $50$ marbles in.",

This is because you can intuitively view each roll as a new game with some stopping threshold that we want to achieve. Therefore, our payout should a function $f(T)$ that we want to maximize. Let's compute what $f(T)$ is now. If we generate a value in excess of $T$, the distribution of that value is Unif$(T,1)$, so the expected value of it is $\\dfrac{1+T}{2}$. However, the expected price to pay for that value is $0.02 \\cdot \\left(\\dfrac{1}{1-T} - 1\\right)$, as the probability that on any given trial we roll a value at least $T$ is $1-T$, so the distribution of the number of trials needed to obtain a value at least $T$ is Geom$(1-T)$. The mean of this distribution is $\\dfrac{1}{1-T}$. The cost per trial besides the first is $0.02$, so this yields our equation above. Therefore, the expected payout is $f(T) = \\dfrac{1+T}{2} - \\dfrac{1}{50} \\cdot \\left(\\dfrac{1}{1-T} - 1\\right)$. As we want to maximize this in $T$, we just take a derivative and set it equal to $0$ to solve. Namely, $f'(T) = \\dfrac{1}{2} - \\dfrac{1}{50(1-T)^2} = 0$. Rearranging this yields $(1-T)^2 = \\dfrac{1}{25} = \\dfrac{1}{5^2}$, so as $0 < T < 1$, the solution is $T = 0.8$. Plugging this back in, $f(0.8) = 0.82$.",

Otherwise, you only need one more tail to finish the game on the next turn. To sum up our reasoning, if you flip $H$, then the event of ending up with a $HT$ depends entirely on the event that you get a $T$. This is because if you do \\textit{not} get a $T$ on the next flip, then you must get a $H$, which means that you have the same chance to finish the game on the next round.

Consider $16$ blanks corresponds to the largest to smallest random variables. We know that $X_{1}$ goes in the first spot because it is known to be the maximum of the first $16$ random variables. Thus, there are $15$ random variables left to arrange to the other $15$ blanks, and we want the probability $X_{16}$ goes in the last spot. Since the other 15 random variables are exchangeable, it is no more likely that $X_{16}$ goes in the last spot than any of $X_2,\\dots, X_{15}$, so the probability is just $\\dfrac{1}{15}$.

Label the random variables $1-3$, based on which interval they end up in. Therefore, we want the probability the median is in $2$. Let's consider the different permutations that allow that to happen: $$122, 123, 223, 222$$ These are the different ways the values of the intervals can be assigned to the random variables. All that remains is to count the permutations. There are $3$ ways to assign the values $122$ to the three random variables (select the random variable that receives $1$ in $3$ ways, the other $2$ receive $2$). Similarly, there are $3! = 6$ ways for $123$, $3$ ways for $223$, and $1$ way for $222$. Adding these all up, there are $3 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 13$ permutations of the values. Then, there are $3^3 = 27$ equally-likely ways to assign the values to the random variables in general. Therefore, the answer is $\\dfrac{13}{27}$.",

    "task": "There are $50$ guests at a party and they are making groups for a game. To do this they each write their name on a piece of paper and put it into a hat. One by one, each guest picks a name from the hat. Each guest will be a part of a group with the guest they pulled the name out of from the hat. If a guest pulls out their own name, they are in a group all by themselves. If Guest A pulls out Guest B's name, Guest B pulls out Guest C's name, and Guest C pulls out Guest A's name, they are all a part of the same closed group and no one else will be able to join them. How many groups will there be on average? Round your answer to the nearest tenth.",
    "hint": "Think of this scenario as each guest being a cable extender there the input end is their hand picking a name out of the hat and the output end is the piece of paper with their name on it.",
    "solution": "You can also think of this scenario as each guest acting like a cable extender. Each cable has an \"input\" side and an \"output\" side. When the first guest picks a name and they pick their own name, its like connecting the two ends of the same wire together. Otherwise you are connected two wires together and making one larger wire with one input end and one output end. A more algebraically-inclined person may want to think of this scenario as the expected number of cycles of a random $50-$permutation. Whichever way you want to think about it, the math stays the same. When the first guest picks a name, there is a $\\dfrac{1}{50}$ chance that the number of groups does not change and a $\\dfrac{49}{50}$ chance that the number of groups effectively decrease by one (because two groups join together). When the next guest picks a number, the given scenario is very similar whether the first guest formed their own group or connected with another guest. Both scenarios have $49$ groups or \"wires\". The only difference is that there's one closed group if the first guest picks their own name versus no closed groups if they pick another guest's name. If we keep continuing this for every guest, we add a closed group with probability $\\dfrac{1}{k}$ where $k$ are the number of names still left in the hat. Thus the answer is $$\\sum_{n=1}^{50} \\frac{1}{n} \\approx 4.5$$",

    "task": "Bill and Bob are simultaneously flipping coins with probability $1/3$ of heads per flip. Find the probability that Bill obtains his first heads in strictly less flips than Bob.",
    "hint": "Find the probability that Bill and Bob obtain their first heads at the same type and use an exchangeability argument.",
    "solution": "Let $X_1$ and $X_2$ represent the number of flips needed for Bill and Bob, respectively, to obtain their first heads. We are going to generalize this to probability $p$ of heads per flip. We immediately know that $X_1,X_2 \\sim \\text{Geom}(p)$ by the fact we are looking for a waiting time until first heads. One might guess that the answer to this is $\\dfrac{1}{2}$, but the issue is that there is positive probability of equality, so we first need to subtract that out, and then we can use exchangeability to claim that $\\mathbb{P}[X_1 > X_2] = \\mathbb{P}[X_1 < X_2]$. First, let's find $\\mathbb{P}[X_1 = X_2]$. This is simple enough to find, as $X_1$ and $X_2$ are independent, so $$\\mathbb{P}[X_1 = X_2] = \\displaystyle \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\mathbb{P}[X_1 = X_2 \\mid X_2 = n]\\mathbb{P}[X_2 = n] = \\displaystyle \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\mathbb{P}[X_1 = n]\\mathbb{P}[X_2 = n]$$ as we want the probability $X_1 = X_2$ and we know that $X_2 = n$. The previous work is just by the Law of Total Probability applied by conditioning on $X_2$. We have that $$\\mathbb{P}[X_1 = n] = \\mathbb{P}[X_2 = n] = p(1-p)^{n-1}$$ by the fact that $X_1$ and $X_2$ are IID. Thus, previous sum becomes $$\\displaystyle \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} p^2(1-p)^{2n-2} = \\displaystyle p^2 \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left[(1-p)^2\\right]^{n-1}$$ by rearranging slightly. We do this because we want to get an $n-1$ in the exponent of the interior since the lower index of the sum is $n=1$ and we would ideally by able to apply the geometric sum formula. The sum inside is now geometric with $r = (1-p)^2 < 1$, so the above expression becomes $\\dfrac{p^2}{1 - (1-p)^2} = \\dfrac{p^2}{p(2-p)} = \\dfrac{p}{2-p}$. This is $\\mathbb{P}[X_1 = X_2]$, so $$\\mathbb{P}[X_1 \\neq X_2] = 1 - \\mathbb{P}[X_1 = X_2] = 1 - \\dfrac{p}{2-p} = \\dfrac{2(1-p)}{2-p}$$. This is $\\mathbb{P}[X_1 \\neq X_2]$, and this is partitioned into two events, namely that $\\mathbb{P}[X_1 \\neq X_2] = \\mathbb{P}[X_1 > X_2] + \\mathbb{P}[X_1 < X_2]$. This is because if they are not equal, then one of them must be larger than the other. Since $X_1$ and $X_2$ are IID, they are exchangeable, so we have that the should have equally likely probabilities of being larger or smaller than one another. Thus, the two probabilities on the RHS are equal. Substituting in our found value on the LHS for $\\mathbb{P}[X_1 \\neq X_2]$, we have that $\\dfrac{2(1-p)}{2-p} = 2\\mathbb{P}[X_1 < X_2]$, meaning that $\\mathbb{P}[X_1 < X_2] = \\dfrac{1-p}{2-p}$. Since there is positive probability of equality between $X_1$ and $X_2$, it makes sense that the probability slightly less than $\\dfrac{1}{2}$. Alternatively, we can give an argument by a one-step Law of Total Probability approach. Let $x$ be the probability in question. We can condition on the $4$ outcomes of the first flip. If Bob flips a heads on the first flip, which occurs with probability $p$, Bill can't obtain a heads before him, so this conditional probability is $0$. If Bob flips a tails, then if Bill flips a heads, he wins immediately. This occurs with probability $p(1-p)$. If Bill flips a tails as well, then the probability is just the same as at the start, which is $x$. Therefore, we obtain the equation $$x = p(1-p) + (1-p)^2x \\iff (2p - p^2)x = p(1-p) \\iff x = \\dfrac{1-p}{2-p}$$ In this case, $p = 1/3$, so our answer is $\\dfrac{2}{5}$.",

Thus, $\\mathbb{E}[T] = (n-(k-1))\\mathbb{E}[I_1]$ by linearity of expectation and exchangeability of the random variables. $\\mathbb{E}[I_1]$ is just the probability that the values are in strictly increasing order. This is the same as randomly permuting those $k$ indices and having the indices be lined up in increasing order, which occurs with probability $\\dfrac{1}{k!}$. Therefore, our answer is $\\dfrac{n-(k-1)}{k!}$ when we have $n$ random variables. Now, we know that $k = 6$ in this example and we want this expectation to be set equal to $1$, so we want to find $n$ satisfying $\\dfrac{n-5}{6!} = 1$, so $n = 6! + 5 = 725$.",

    "task": "You are given a fair $20-$sided die and 100 actions in a game. The die starts with upface $1$. The two options you can perform are to roll and to take. Performing a roll re-rolls the current upface of the die. Performing a take allows you to cash out the current upface of the die. Note that the game does not end when you perform a take and that you do not have to roll between takes. Therefore, for example, you can just perform $100$ takes on the initial $\\$1$ upface and walk away with $\\$100$ guaranteed. Your strategy is to cash out the upface when you roll at least some threshold $n$ for the first time. You fix this $n$ at the beginning of the game.

    "hint": "The stopping value is going to be in the form of taking after you have obtained a value at least $k$ for the first time.

Therefore, if you take when you have at least $k$ for the first time, your expected face showing is $\\dfrac{20+k}{2}$.

    "task": "Two players, a gambler and dealer, play continuous blackjack. The gambler goes first and generates a uniformly random number in $(0,1)$. At any time, they can choose to stop or play again. If they play again, they generate another independent uniform random number in $(0,1)$. If the sum of the generated numbers exceeds $1$, the gambler busts and the dealer wins. Otherwise, if the gambler stops at some value $0 \\leq a \\leq 1$, then the dealer begins generating independent uniform random numbers in $(0,1)$. The dealer keeps adding the values up until he either obtains a sum in the interval $(a,1)$ (in which case the dealer wins) or obtains a sum larger than $1$ (in which case the gambler wins). The strategy of the gambler is going to be to stop when the sum is at least $\\alpha$ and hit (generate another random number) if the sum is below $\\alpha$. The $\\alpha$ that maximizes the probability of the gambler winning solves $e^{\\alpha} = \\dfrac{e + \\alpha}{x + y\\alpha}$ for integers $x$ and $y$. $e$ here is Euler's constant. Find $x^2 + y^2$.",
    "hint": "Find the functions $q(x)$ and $r(x)$ that respectively represent the gambler's probability of losing given that he stops at current sum $x$ and hits at current sum $x$. Then $\\alpha$ satisfies $q(\\alpha) = r(\\alpha)$.",
    "solution": "What we need to do is find the functions $q(x)$ and $r(x)$ that respectively represent the gambler's probability of losing given that he stops at current sum $x$ and hits at current sum $x$. Let's first find $q(x)$. $q(x)$ is the probability that we lose given that stop at a sum $x$. The gambler loses if the successive drawings of the dealer produce a partial sum $s_{n_1}$ in the interval $(x,1)$. This would imply that there is a $n \\geq 0$ such that $s_n \\leq x$ but $x \\leq s_{n+1} \\leq 1$. We can sum over all cases of $n$ at the end. The probability that $s_n \\leq x$ is a common question that has a known answer of $\\dfrac{x^n}{n!}$. This can be seen by considering the volume of the region $\\{0 \\leq X_1 + \\dots +X_n \\leq x\\}$. Then, the probability that the $(n+1)$st draw puts $s_{n+1}$ in the interval $(x,1)$, which is of length $1-x$, is $1-x$. Therefore, multiplying then, the probability that this happens with exactly $n+1$ random variables is $\\dfrac{x^n}{n!}(1-x)$. Summing this over $n$ yields $$q(x) = \\displaystyle \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\dfrac{x^n}{n!}(1-x) = (1-x)e^x$$ Now, to find $r(x)$, the probability of losing given you hit and the current sum is $x$, we need to consider two cases. If the current sum is $x$, then we automatically lose if we bust. We bust if the next draw is at least $1-x$, as the sum would be at least $1$, so the probability of this is $x$. Alternatively, by Law of Total Probability and conditioning on the fact that the next draw is at most $1-x$ (so we don't bust), we just integrate over $q$ from $x$ to $1$, as those are the possible values we can receive. Therefore, $$r(x) = \\displaystyle \\int_x^1 q(t)dt + x = x + e - (2-x)e^x$$ Note that the function $q(x)$ is decreasing in $(0,1)$ and $r(x)$ is increasing in $(0,1)$. Therefore, $\\alpha$ solves $q(\\alpha) = r(\\alpha)$, where we are indifferent to hitting or stopping. This means that $(1-\\alpha)e^{\\alpha} = \\alpha + e - (2-\\alpha)e^{\\alpha}$, so $(3-2\\alpha)e^{\\alpha} = e + \\alpha$, lastly implying that $e^{\\alpha} = \\dfrac{e+\\alpha}{3-2\\alpha}$. This means $x = 3$ and $y = -2$, so $x^2 + y^2 = 13$.",

Otherwise, if our next value is $y&ltx$, $y$ is uniformly distributed on $(0,x)$, so the expected minimum in that case is $f(y)$. We integrate over all $0 < y < x$ since we are applying Law of Total Probability. Written as an equation, this is $$f(x) = x(1-x) + \\displaystyle \\int_0^x f(y)dy$$ Taking the derivative to convert into a differential equation, we get that $f'(x) = f(x) + (1-2x)$. Equivalently, $f'(x) - f(x) = 1-2x$. An initial condition for this differential equation is $f(0) = 0$, as we can't go any lower than $0$. This is a linear first order differential equation, so we can use the method of integrating factors here. In particular, the integrating factor is $\\mu(x) = e^{\\int -1 dx} = e^{-x}$. Multiplying this on both sides, $(e^{-x}f(x))' = (1-2x)e^{-x}$, meaning $e^{-x}f(x) = \\displaystyle \\int e^{-x} - 2xe^{-x} dx= (2x+1)e^{-x} + C$. This means that $f(x) = 1+2x+ Ce^x$. Using our initial condition $f(0) = 0$, this immediately yields $C = -1$, so $f(x) = 1+2x - e^x$. In particular, $f(1) = 3-e$, so our answer is $3 - 1 =2$.",

Otherwise, you receive nothing. Assuming optimal play, find the smallest integer $t$ at which we guess that the second roll is lower than the first.",
    "hint": "We have two strategies corresponding to each $t$, which are betting higher and lower. Compute the expected returns for each of the two strategies for each $t$ and then set them equal.",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the value of our first roll. Our optimal strategy is going to be that we say the second roll is lower if $x \\geq t$ for some threshold $t$ and higher if $x < t$. Let $t$ be an integer. We have two strategies corresponding to each $t$, which are betting higher and lower. Let's compute the expected returns for each of the two strategies for each $t$. Let $R_{l,t}$ denote the returns of the strategy where we guess lower for the second roll with first roll being $t$ and $Y$ be the value of the second roll. Then $\\mathbb{E}[R_{l,t}] = \\mathbb{E}[R_{l,t} \\mid Y < t]\\mathbb{P}[Y < t] + \\mathbb{E}[R_{l,t} \\mid Y \\geq t]\\mathbb{P}[Y \\geq t]$ by Law of Total Expectation. The second term evaluates to $0$, since we receive no payout if we guess incorrectly. Given $Y < t$, we know that the value is discrete uniform on $\\{1,2,\\dots, t-1\\}$, which has a mean of $\\dfrac{t}{2}$. The probability of observing a value that is strictly less than $t$ is $\\dfrac{t-1}{100}$, as there are $t-1$ integers in $\\{1,2,\\dots, t-1\\}$. Therefore, $\\mathbb{E}[R_{l,t}] = \\dfrac{1}{100} \\cdot \\dfrac{t(t-1)}{2}$. Similarly, let $R_{h,t}$ denote the returns of the strategy where we guess higher for the second roll with the first roll being $t$ and $Y$ be the value of the second roll. Then $\\mathbb{E}[R_{h,t}] = \\mathbb{E}[R_{h,t} \\mid Y < t]\\mathbb{P}[Y < t] + \\mathbb{E}[R_{h,t} \\mid Y \\geq t]\\mathbb{P}[Y \\geq t]$ by Law of Total Expectation. The first term evaluates to $0$, since we receive no payout if we guess incorrectly. Given $Y \\geq t$, we know that the value is discrete uniform on $\\{t,t+1,\\dots, 100\\}$, which has mean $\\dfrac{100+t}{2}$. The probability of rolling a value at least $t$ is $\\dfrac{100 - (t-1)}{100}$, as it is the complement of the previous probability. Therefore, the expected payout in this case is $\\dfrac{1}{100} \\cdot \\dfrac{(100+t)(101-t)}{2}$ We now want to find the point of indifference i.e. when are the expected returns between guessing higher and lower equal. Note that $\\mathbb{E}[R_{l,t}]$ is increasing in $t$ while $\\mathbb{E}[R_{h,t}]$ is decreasing in $t$. This means that for whatever $t^*$ these two functions are equal at, we will guess lower for any value $> t^*$ and higher for any value $\\leq t^*$ on the first roll. After cancelling denominators, we must solve $(100+t)(101-t) = t(t-1)$. This can be rearranged to $-2t^2+2t+10100 = 0$, at which $$t^* = \\dfrac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 - 4(-2)(10100)}}{2(-2)} = \\dfrac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{80804}}{-4}$$ Clearly, we are going need to subtract the square root, as otherwise $t^*$ will be negative. Once we do this, we see our threshold is approximately $71.57$. Therefore, if our first roll is $\\geq 72$, we will guess lower for the second roll, meaning $72$ is the answer.",

There are $\\binom{k-1}{4}$ ways to pick the spots of the $4$ kings in the first $k-1$ spots. Then, there are $P(40,5)$ ways to permute the kings to the $4$ spots selected in the first $k-1$ spots and the $k$th spot. Then, there are $P(480,k-5)$ ways to pick $k-5$ of the other $480$ cards that are not kings to go in the other $k-5$ spots before $k$ that are not kings. We choose specifically non-kings so that we don't have another king before the $k$th spot (and hence the 5th king would not show up at the $k$th spot). There are obviously $P(520,k)$ ways to permute $k$ cards of the first $520$ to the first $k$ spots, so $$\\mathbb{P}[X = k] = \\dfrac{\\binom{k-1}{m}P(40,5)P(480,k-5)}{P(520,k)}$$ The support of this is $k = 5, 6, \\dots, 485$.

    "task": "You have a 10-sided die. What is the expected number of times you must roll until the least common multiple of your die rolls exceeds $2000$? The answer can be written as a simplified fraction of the form $\\dfrac{p}{q}$. Find $p + q$.",
    "hint": "What groups of numbers are enough to satisfy the condition?",
    "solution": "Notice that the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers from $1$ to $10$ is $2520$. It is therefore not possible to end up with any other LCM, as dividing $2520$ by any prime factor would yield a number smaller than $2000$. With some work, we see that we must obtain the numbers $7, 8, 9,$ and at least one of $5$ or $10$. Although we cannot directly apply the expected value expression for geometric random variable, we can consider two cases: Case $1$: We get $7, 8,$ and $9$ before $5$ or $10$. Consider the sequence in which we encounter each of these values for the first time. Any permutation of this sequence is equally likely, so $7, 8,$ and $9$ are before $5$ or $10$ when the latter two are the final two values in the sequence, which occurs with probability $\\dfrac{1}{{5 \\choose 2}} = \\dfrac{1}{10}$. Case $2$: The complement of case $1$. Clearly, the probability of this case occurring is $\\dfrac{9}{10}$. Now we may consider the expected number of rolls before obtaining $7, 8,$ and $9$. $\\dfrac{9}{10}$ of the time, a multiple of $5$ has already been obtained by then, and we are done. The other $\\dfrac{1}{10}$ of the time, we must continue rolling until we obtain a multiple of $5$. Evaluating this with standard geometric expectation, we have $$\\dfrac{10}{3} + \\dfrac{10}{2} + \\dfrac{10}{1} + \\dfrac{1}{10} \\cdot \\dfrac{10}{2} = \\dfrac{113}{6}$$ Our desired answer is $113 + 6 = 119$. Note that even if we didn't realize we could split the cases cleanly into whether we roll a multiple of $5$ before or after we roll $7, 8,$ and $9$, casework on the order in which we get the multiple of $5$ yields the same result, albeit with more computation.",

    "task": "A frog performs a simple symmetric random walk on the integers, starting at position $5$ and hopping 1 unit up or down at each step with equal probability. Find the expected of number of times that the frog lands on position $1000$ before landing on position $0$.",
    "hint": "If a random walk starts at integer position $a$ and $0 < a < b$, $b$ being an integer, then the probability that the random walk hits $b$ before $0$ is $\\dfrac{a}{b}$",
    "solution": "We are going to use one important fact about simple symmetric random walks here repeatedly: If a random walk starts at integer position $a$ and $0 < a < b$, $b$ being an integer, then the probability that the random walk hits $b$ before $0$ is $\\dfrac{a}{b}$. This can be proved using martingale theory. With this fact equipped, if $N$ is the number of visits to $1000$ before $0$, we are going to calculate $\\mathbb{P}_5[N = k]$, where $\\mathbb{P}_a$ denotes that we are calculating starting at position $a$. First, we can see by the above fact that $\\mathbb{P}_5[N = 0] = \\dfrac{199}{200}$. This is because the probability we reach $1000$ before $0$ is $\\dfrac{5}{1000} = \\dfrac{1}{200}$, so the probability we reach $0$ before $1000$ is the complement of this. Now, to calculate $\\mathbb{P}_5[N = 1]$, we must reach $1000$ and then go back to $0$. The probability of reaching $1000$ before $0$ is $\\dfrac{1}{200}$. Then, once we are at position $1000$, we must return down to $0$ and not visit back. This means that we must go down from $1000$ to $999$ the moment we hit position $1000$, occurring with probability $\\dfrac{1}{2}$. Then, afterwards, starting from position $999$, we must hit $0$ before $1000$. This is just $\\dfrac{1}{1000}$ by the same complementation idea above, so our total probability is $\\dfrac{1}{200} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{2} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{1000} = \\dfrac{1}{200} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{2000}$. To calculate $\\mathbb{P}_5[N = 2]$, we must reach $1000$, return to $1000$ one time, and then go back to $0$. The probability of reaching $1000$ before $0$ starting from position $5$ is $\\dfrac{1}{200}$. Then, to return to $1000$ once, we condition on the first step once we are at $1000$. If we go up, which occurs with probability $\\dfrac{1}{2}$, then we will reach $1000$ before going to $0$ with probability $1$. If we go down, which occurs with probability $\\dfrac{1}{2}$, we will return to $1000$ from $999$ with probability $\\dfrac{999}{1000}$. Therefore, the total probability of returning to $1000$ once is $\\dfrac{\\frac{999}{1000} + 1}{2} = \\dfrac{1999}{2000}$. After we return once to $1000$, from there, we need to go back to $0$ before returning again. This probability is $\\dfrac{1}{2000}$ from before. Therefore, $\\mathbb{P}_5[N = 1] = \\dfrac{1}{200} \\cdot \\dfrac{1999}{2000} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{2000}$. With all of this equipped, we will now calculate $\\mathbb{P}_5[N = k]$. This means that we first need to hit $1000$ once, which occurs with probability $\\dfrac{1}{200}$. From there, we must return to $1000$ exactly $k-1$ times before hitting $0$. This occurs with probability $\\left(\\dfrac{1999}{2000}\\right)^{k-1}$, as it was $\\dfrac{1999}{2000}$ for returning exactly once, so every time we hit $1000$, by the Strong Markov Property, we can view the future independent of the past, and we do this $k-1$ times. Lastly, after this, we need to hit $0$ before $1000$, which occurs with probability $\\dfrac{1}{2000}$. Therefore, for integers $k > 0$, $$\\mathbb{P}_5[N = k] = \\dfrac{1}{200} \\cdot \\left(\\dfrac{1999}{2000}\\right)^{k-1} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{2000}$$ In other words, we can say that $N = 0$ with probability $\\dfrac{199}{2000}$ and $N \\sim \\text{Geom}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{2000}\\right)$ with probability $\\dfrac{1}{200}$. Therefore $$\\mathbb{E}_5[N] = \\mathbb{E}_5[N \\mid N = 0]\\mathbb{P}_5[N = 0] + \\mathbb{E}_5[N \\mid N > 0]\\mathbb{P}_5[N > 0]$$ The first term is clearly just $0$ due to the expected value part. $\\mathbb{E}_5[N \\mid N > 0] = 2000$ as that is the mean of a $\\text{Geom}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{2000}\\right)$ random variable. Lastly, we know the last part is just $\\dfrac{1}{200}$ from our prior calculations, so $\\mathbb{E}_5[N] = 10$.",

    "task": "We toss 3 pebbles at a tic-tac-toe board at the same time. Each of those pebbles will land in one of the nine squares of the board with uniform probability. What is the probability that the pebbles will land in such a way that they form a tic-tac-toe (all pebbles in a row either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally)?",
    "hint": "Each pebble doesn't have to be in a unique square!",
    "solution": "There are 8 ways to forma a tic-tac-toe (3 vertically, 3 horizontally, 2 diagonally). Including the permutations, we multiply by $3!$. Thus the total ways is $8*3! = 48$. Now we have to see how many different ways the pebbles can land on the board. The first scenario is that they all land in distinct squares. Since there are 9 total squares and we pick 3 to be where the pebbles land, the total combinations are $\\displaystyle \\binom{9}{3} = 84$. Each of these combinations has $3!$ permutations in their order. Thus $84*3! = 504$. Now we have to calculate the number of ways the pebbles could land in two distinct squares. Similar to the three square scenario, we choose two squares from the nine. Including permutations, the total number of arrangements with two squares is $\\displaystyle \\binom{9}{2}*3! = 216$. Finally, all three pebbles can land in the same square which adds an extra 9 ways. Thus in total there are $504+216+9 = 729$ ways. Thus the probability is $$\\dfrac{48}{729} = \\dfrac{16}{243}$$ Alternatively, a faster way to do this is to consider that there are $9*9*9 = 729$ total possibilities how each pebble lands. Since there are 8 winning patterns and each has $3!$ permutations, there are $\\dfrac{8*3!}{729} = \\dfrac{48}{729} = \\dfrac{16}{243}$.",

In other words, target $A$ covers the interval $[1-\\varepsilon, 1+\\varepsilon]$, while target $B$ covers the interval $[3-2\\varepsilon, 3+2\\varepsilon]$. You have one dart to shoot at the line. Your goal is to maximize your probability of hitting one of the targets. You can choose where to center your throw on the line. If you select to center your dart at $\\mu$, the actual position your dart lands at is $X \\sim N(\\mu,4)$. Find the value of $\\mu$ that maximizes your chances of hitting a target. If necessary, round your answer to the nearest hundredth.",
    "hint": "The key here is to note that since the targets are of extremely small radius, we can essentially treat them as points. How do you account for the difference in radii?",
    "solution": "The key here is to note that since the targets are of extremely small radius, we can essentially treat them as points. The approximate probability we hit target $A$ would be approximately $f(x_A)\\varepsilon$, where $f(x_A)$ is the probability density at point $A$. However, since $B$ is also of small radius $2\\varepsilon$, the probability we hit target $B$ is approximately $2f(x_B)\\varepsilon$. Since the two targets are disjoint, our goal is to maximize the weighted sum of the probability densities. Our probability density here is dependent on what $\\mu$ we select. Therefore, as a function of $\\mu$, we need to maximize $$f(\\mu) = \\dfrac{1}{2\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\left(e^{-\\frac{(-1-\\mu)^2}{8}} + 2e^{-\\frac{(3-\\mu)^2}{8}}\\right)$$ The two interior terms are just the density of a $N(\\mu,4)$ distribution at $-1$ and $3$. To do this, we take the derivative and set it equal to $0$. In particular, $$f'(\\mu) = \\dfrac{1}{2\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\left[\\dfrac{-1-\\mu}{4}e^{-\\frac{(-1-\\mu)^2}{8}} + \\dfrac{3-\\mu}{2}e^{-\\frac{(3-\\mu)^2}{8}}\\right] = 0$$ Using a computer system, $f'(\\mu) = 0$ for $\\mu \\approx 2.649$. One can verify that this is indeed a maxima, so $2.65$ is our answer. This intuitively makes sense, as the increased size of the region around $3$ means that we should assign more density there. Thus, our answer should be closer to $3$ than it is to $-1$.",

If the particle moves right, which occurs with probability $p$, then position $1$ is reached. Otherwise, the particle reaches position $-1$. From $-1$, the particle first needs to reach $0$ again, which occurs with probability $x_1$, and then from there, reach position $1$, which occurs with probability $x_1$ as well. Therefore, given the particle moves left, the probability it reaches position $1$ is $x_1^2$.

Since $x_1 \\leq 1$, we know that for $p \\geq 1/2$, $x_1 = 1$, as the other root would be larger than $1$. For $p < 1/2$, the random walk is biased down, so it is not probability $1$ that the particle ever reaches $1$. This argument can be made more rigorous using more mathematically advanced tools, but those are not of concern here. Therefore, the answer for $p < 1/2$ is $\\dfrac{p}{1-p}$.

    "task": "A random word generator generates strings of $5$ letters from the set $\\{a,b,c,d,e\\}$ with repetition allowed. However, you also know that no character is used more than twice and that no two consecutive characters are the same. How many strings are there?",
    "hint": "First, find how many passcodes there are that have no two consecutive characters the same, disregarding the other constraint. There are $5$ options for the first character. How many options for the remaining characters?",
    "solution": "First, let's find how many strings there are that have no two consecutive characters the same, disregarding the other constraint. There are $5$ options for the first character and then $4$ options for each of the other $4$, as the only character disallowed at each step is the one used in the previous spot. Therefore, there are $5 \\cdot 4^4 = 1280$ such sequences. We now need to exclude all of sequences that have $3,4,$ or $5$ of a given character that also satisfy the condition that no two consecutive characters are the same. There are no sequences included in the $1280$ above that have $4$ or $5$ of the same character, as there will always be two of the same that touch. For the case of $3$ of the same character, the sequence would be in the form $XYXZX$, where $X,Y,$ and $Z$ are any of the letters in our set with $X \\neq Y$ and $X \\neq Z$. There are $5$ options for $X$ and $4$ options for each of $Y$ and $Z$, so there are $5 \\cdot 4^2 = 80$ sequences that we have to remove. Therefore, our total number of valid sequences is $1280 - 80 = 1200$.",

We can't choose $2$, $3$, or $5$ since they are prime and don't have any more factors. We should never choose $4$ because we then can't take $8$ later. In this case, the best choice to take is $9$ since it is one of the larger numbers and only has one factor left ($3$). Now the board becomes $2$, $4$, $5$, $6$, $8$, and $10$. Out of this set, $6$ is the only number with only one factor so lets take it. Now the taxman takes $2$. The board is now $4$, $5$, $8$, and $10$. Now it doesn't matter what order we take $8$ and $10$, the taxman will get $4$ and $5$. Thus the numbers we have are $6$, $7$, $8$, $9$, and $10$ which gives you a score of $40$ and the taxman has $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$ which gives them a score of $15$. You win with a score of $40$!",

They each have only one bullet in their guns and they can take it out and shoot at any point along the walk. Given that they are at position $x$, Mordecai has probability $m(x) = x$ of hitting the Turducken with his shot. Rigby has probability $r(x) = x^2$ of hitting the Turducken. If they shoot at the same time and both miss or hit the Turducken, then they just start again with a new Turducken. If exactly one of them hits the Turducken, then that person gets to keep it for Thanksgiving dinner. They don't neccesarily need to shoot at the same time. Assuming both Mordecai and Rigby apply an optimal strategy, what is Mordecai's chance of keeping the Turducken? The answer is in the form $\\dfrac{\\sqrt{a} - b}{c}$ for integers $a,b,c > 0$ that are pairwise relatively prime. Find $a + b + c$. Note that Mordecai and Rigby both know $m(x)$ and $r(x)$.",

Alternatively, if Rigby shoots first at position $x$, then with probability $x^2$ he wins, while with probability $1-x^2$, Mordecai wins. Therefore, the optimal strategy for each is to minimize the other person's chance of winning. For Mordecai, this function that he needs to minimize is $\\text{max}\\{x^2,1-x\\}$. For Rigby, this function is $\\text{min}\\{x,1-x^2\\}$. However, note that $x^2$ is monotonically increasing and $1-x$ is monotonically decreasing. Similarly, $x$ is monotonically increasing and $1-x^2$ is monotonically decreasing. Therefore, for each function, there is a unique point at which the two respective functions are equal and that will be the minimum. For Mordecai, the equation that must be solved is $x^2 = 1-x$. For Rigby, the equation that needs to be solved is $x = 1-x^2$. However, by rearranging both equations, we can see that the optimal $x$ for both is when $x + x^2 = 1$. This implies that they should both shoot at the same time. Solving this quadratic equation yields the optimal $x^* = \\dfrac{\\sqrt{5} - 1}{2}$. Rigby's equation is the chance of Mordecai winning, so as $x^* = 1-(x^*)^2$, we have that Mordecai's chance of winning is just $\\dfrac{\\sqrt{5} - 1}{2}$.",

    "solution": "Let $B^*$ denote a boy born on a Friday, and let $B$ denote a boy not born on a Friday. Additionally, let $G$ denote a girl. The two ways we can obtain 2 boys is if they are both born on a Friday, or if only one of them is born on a Friday. We know at least one is a boy born on a Friday, so $BB$ is not possible. The total ways to obtain at least one boy born on a Friday is to have the two cases above OR have one boy born on a Friday and one girl (irrelevant which day she is born on). Thus, we want $\\dfrac{\\mathbb{P}[B^*B^* \\cup B^*B]}{\\mathbb{P}[B^*B^* \\cup B^*B \\cup B^*G]}$. I am disregarding order of birth here, which will account for later. These are all disjoint events, so by the Kolmogorov Axioms on the probability measure, we can separate out each of the individual events and take the sum of their probabilities. We can assume independence upon gender from birth to birth, equally likely probabilities of birth on any given day of the week, and independence between day of the week of birth and gender. We can find easily find $\\mathbb{P}[B^*] = \\dfrac{1}{2} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{7} = \\dfrac{1}{14}$ and $\\mathbb{P}[B] = \\dfrac{1}{2} \\cdot \\dfrac{6}{7} = \\dfrac{6}{14}$. Thus, since there is independence from birth to birth, $\\mathbb{P}[B^*B^*] = \\dfrac{1}{14} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{14} = \\dfrac{1}{196}$ and $\\mathbb{P}[B^*B] = 2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{14} \\cdot \\dfrac{6}{14} = \\dfrac{12}{196}$. Note the factor of $2$ out front, as we can arrange the location of the boy born on a Friday to either be the first born or the second born, so there are 2 arrangements. Lastly, $\\mathbb{P}[B^*G] = 2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{14} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{2} = \\dfrac{14}{196}$. Factor of $2$ out front for same reason as above. Thus, we have our final probability as $$\\dfrac{\\mathbb{P}[B^*B^* \\cup B^*B]}{\\mathbb{P}[B^*B^* \\cup B^*B \\cup B^*G]} = \\dfrac{\\mathbb{P}[B^*B^*] + \\mathbb{P}[B^*B]}{\\mathbb{P}[B^*B^*] + \\mathbb{P}[B^*B] + \\mathbb{P}[B^*G]} = \\dfrac{\\frac{1}{196} + \\frac{12}{196}}{\\frac{1}{196} + \\frac{12}{196} + \\frac{14}{196}} = \\dfrac{13}{27}$$ How do we reconcile this increase due to something seemingly irrelevant?

    "task": "Gabe and a student have decided to meet up to discuss probability. The student is very prompt and will show up at a uniformly random time between $4$ and $5$ PM. Gabe is a tad late, so he will show up at a uniformly random time between $4:30$ and $5$ PM. For whichever person gets there first, they will wait up to 10 minutes, and if the other person has not shown up, they will leave. Find the probability that the meeting occurs.",
    "hint": "Let $G$ and $S$ be the number of minutes after 4 PM that Gabe and the student show up, respectively. Then we have that $G \\sim \\text{Unif}(30,60)$ and $S \\sim \\text{Unif}(0,60)$. What is the event that the meeting occurs in terms of $G$ and $S$?",
    "solution": "First, let's model this mathematically. Let $G$ and $S$ be the number of minutes after 4 PM that Gabe and the student show up, respectively. Then we have that $G \\sim \\text{Unif}(30,60)$ and $S \\sim \\text{Unif}(0,60)$. The event that the meeting occurs is the just the event that $|G-S| \\leq 10$, as they must differ by up to $10$ minutes. We should draw out the region in the plane to see what we are working with. If you put $G$ on the $x$-axis and $S$ on the $y$-axis, we have a tall rectangle. When drawing the two lines corresponding to $|G-S| \\leq 10$, you will notice that it is easier to calculate the probability of the complement, as those are easier regions to work with. You will see that there is one trapezoid and one triangle. It is easy enough to use some basic algebra to note that the slope is $1$, so the line will go as far vertically as it does horizontally. You will find that the base of the trapezoid is $30$, and the two heights are $20$ and $50$, so its area is $1050$. The two sides of the triangle are $20$ each, so the area is $200$. Thus, the probability of the complement is $\\dfrac{25}{36}$. Thus, the probability in the question is $\\dfrac{11}{36}$",

    "task": "You have $3$ cards, each labeled $n$, $n+1$, $n+2$, and you don't know $n$. All cards start face down. You flip one card and observe the value.

The expected out payout of this strategy is $n + c$ for some constant $c$. Find $c$.",
    "hint": "For simplicity, we can assume the values of the cards are $1,2,$ and $3$, as $n$ is arbitrary and is just a shifting factor. If you make a decision at the first or third card, you have no choice on what the card will be, so the expected value will be $2$ in each of those cases.

    "solution": "For simplicity, we can assume the values of the cards are $1,2,$ and $3$, as $n$ is arbitrary and is just a shifting factor. If you make a decision at the first or third card, you have no choice on what the card will be, so the expected value will be $2$ in each of those cases. Therefore, to do better, we should consider devising a strategy at the second card drawn. Suppose the two cards you have drawn, in order, are $a$ and $b$. The possible values for $a-b$ are $\\pm 2$ or $\\pm 1$. We break up into cases based on the values of $a-b$. $\\textbf{Case 1:}$ If $a-b = \\pm 2$, then you know the largest and smallest card among the three, so you just select the larger card in this case and you're done. $\\textbf{Case 2:}$ If $a-b = 1$, which occurs with the starting sequence $21$ and $32$, we would have $3$ and $1$ as our last card. The expected value of the second card in this case is $3/2$ (either $1$ or $2$ with equal probability), whereas the expected value of the last card is $2$ ($3$ or $1$ with equal probability), so we should select the third card in this case. $\\textbf{Case 3:}$ If $a-b = -1$, which occurs with the starting sequence $12$ or $23$, we would again have $3$ and $1$ as our last card. The expected value of the last card is the same still, but the expected value of the second card is now $5/2$, which is larger than $2$, so we should stay at the second card. In summary, for each of the permutations of $1,2,3$ under this strategy, we select the following cards: $$213: 3, 231: 3, 321: 1, 123: 2, 132: 3, 312: 2$$ Therefore, the expected value of the card is $$\\dfrac{3+3+1+2+3+2}{6} = \\dfrac{8}{3}$$ This was the case where $n = 1$, so to shift with $n,n+1,$ and $n+2$, the answer would be $n + 4/3$.

    "solution": "Let $x$ be the age of the $10$s digit child and $y$ be the age of the $1$s digit child. We know that the age of the grandmother is $10x + y$. Therefore, the sum of all of their ages is $11x + 2y$. Thus, $11x + 2y = 98$. We know that each of $x$ and $y$ need to be an integer between $1$ and $9$, inclusive of both, as the age of each child is a digit. Since $11x + 2y = 98$, we need $x$ to be large, as it has a significantly larger coefficient. Consider $x = 7, 8, 9$. For $x = 7$, $2y = 21$, which means $y$ is larger than $10$. Therefore, this does not work. If $x = 8,$ then $2y = 10$, in which case $y = 5$. This is a possibility. If $x = 9$, then $2y = -1$, meaning $y$ is negative (and also not an integer), so this is impossible. Therefore, $x = 8$ and $y = 5$, so the age of the grandmother is $85$.",

The key observation is here that the $(n+1)$st line that is added should intersect each of the first $n$ lines, and this yields $n+1$ distinct regions. We can see this in the small cases of $n = 1, 2,$ and $3$. More rigorously, the $(n+1)$st line splits $k$ of the old regions exactly when it intersects the existing lines in $k-1$ places. As two lines can only intersect in at most one point, then this implies $L_{n+1} \\leq L_n + (n+1)$, as we get $k \\leq n+1$ given that the new line can intersect the old lines in at most $n$ places. However, it is also possible to place the line so that it is non-parallel to every other existing line and it doesn't intersect at any existing intersection points. Therefore, $L_{n+1} \\geq L_n + (n+1)$ by the same logic. This means we derived the recurrence $L_{n+1} = L_n + (n+1)$, which simply has the solution $$L_{n} = \\dfrac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1$$ Plugging in $n = 10$, we see that our answer is $56$.",

By applying the law of total probability, we can rewrite this value as \\[\\begin{aligned} \\mathbb{P}(R) &= \\mathbb{P}(R \\cap A) + \\mathbb{P}(R \\cap A^c) \\\\ &= \\mathbb{P}(R | A)\\mathbb{P}(A) + \\mathbb{P}(R | B)\\mathbb{P}(B). \\end{aligned}\\] If we are given that the cherry originates from bowl $A$, then the probability that it is red is simply $\\frac{4}{9}$. Similarly, if we are given that the cherry originates from bowl $B$, then the probability that it is red is simply $\\frac{6}{9} = \\frac{2}{3}$. Putting it all together, we conclude \\[\\begin{aligned} \\mathbb{P}(R) &= \\mathbb{P}(R | A)\\mathbb{P}(A) + \\mathbb{P}(R | B)\\mathbb{P}(B) \\\\ &= \\frac{4}{9} \\cdot \\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{6}{9} \\cdot \\frac{9}{10} \\\\ &= \\frac{29}{45} \\end{aligned}\\]",

    "hint": "Use a \"first ace\" approach and condition on whether or not the first card between king and ace to appear is king vs. ace. What needs to happen afterwards in each scenario?",
    "solution": "To observe either $2$ kings or $1$ king and $1$ ace, we need to condition on which of king or ace appears first in the deck. If king appears first, then we need to find the number of cards until we observe either a king or an ace. If ace appears first, then we need to find the number of cards until we observe a king. For the first king/ace to be drawn, it is equally likely to be either of them. From here on out, $K$ is king and $A$ is ace. First, we need to find the expected number of cards until the first $K$ or $A$ appears. We can use the First Ace methodology to use the dividers as $K$ or $A$, yielding $8$ dividers. These $8$ dividers divide the other $52-8 = 44$ cards into $9$ equally-sized regions in expectation, so there are $44/9$ cards on average before the first $K$ or $A$. Then, we need to add in $1$ card for actually picking that $K$ or $A$. Now, with probability $1/2$, we selected $K$. In this case, we need to find the expected number of cards until either a $K$ or $A$ appears in the remaining deck. There are now $7$ dividers ($4$ $A$ and $3$ $K$) and $52 - 44/9 - 1 - 7 = 352/9$ cards left in the deck on average. Since there are $7$ dividers, there are now $8$ equally-sized regions in expectation, so the expected number of cards before observing the next $K$ or $A$ is $352/72$. Then, we must add in $1$ for selecting the $K$ or $A$, yielding a conditional expectation of $424/72$ in this case. With probability $1/2$, we selected $A$. In this case, we need to find the expected number of cards until a $K$ appears. There are now $4$ dividers (corresponding to the $4$ $K$) and $52 - 44/9 - 1 - 4 = 379/9$ cards left in the deck on average. The $4$ dividers split up our remaining deck into $5$ equally-sized regions in expectation, so there are $379/45$ cards before the first $K$ on average. Then, we need to add in $1$ more back for selecting the $K$, so our conditional expectation here is $424/45$. Putting it all together, our final answer is $$\\dfrac{44}{9} + 1 + \\dfrac{1}{2} \\cdot \\dfrac{424}{45} + \\dfrac{1}{2} \\cdot \\dfrac{424}{72} = \\dfrac{1219}{90} \\approx 13.54$$",

Using the underlying, the bond, and the put, we can see that we have $$\\max(S_T - K, 0) = S_T - K + \\max(K-S_T,0)$$ In other words, a call option is equivalent to going long $1$ unit of the underlying, borrowing $K$ units of the bond, and long $1$ unit of the put. This then gives us $V_0 = 8 -10e^{-.02} + 3.2 = 1.40$ Intuitively, this also makes sense. The current price of the underlying is $8$ while the strike is $10$. So, our puts are in-the-money while the calls are out-of-the-money. In other words, the puts should have more value than the calls (which we indeed see). $$\\\\$$ This is also known as put-call parity, where we can replicate a call-option with a forward ($S_T - K$) and a put option at strike $K$.

Since this sphere is clearly symmetric about the origin and all of the coordinates share the same marginal distributions, they are exchangeable and hence has the same expectation. Therefore, $\\mathbb{E}[R^2] = 10\\mathbb{E}[X_1^2]$. We know that Var$(X_1) = \\mathbb{E}[X_1^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[X_1])^2$. However, as our sphere is again symmetric about the origin, the mean of $X_1$ is $0$, so we just need to find the second moment of $X_1$ and we are done. This boils down to, by the above, finding the expected squared distance from the center. Let's compute $\\mathbb{P}[R \\leq r]$. The volume of a $n-$dimensional sphere of radius $r$ is a constant $C_n \\cdot r^n$. Therefore, as we select uniformly at random from this sphere, the probability of the event $\\{R \\leq r\\}$ just means that our point belongs to the sub-sphere of radius $r$ from the big sphere of radius $12$. The probability of this is $\\dfrac{C_{10}r^{10}}{C_{10}\\cdot 12^{10}} = \\dfrac{r^{10}}{12^{10}}$. Therefore, the probability density of $R$ (found by taking the derivative with respect to $r$ of the CDF) is $f_R(r) = \\dfrac{10r^9}{12^{10}}I_{(0,12)}(r)$.

    "task": "A bag has $19$ fair coins and one double-headed coin. We pick a coin uniformly at random from the bag. What is the minimum number of times this coin would need to appear heads in a row to be at least $95\\%$ certain that the coin we have is the double-headed coin?",
    "hint": "Use Bayes' Rule to get the probability that given we observe $n$ consecutive heads, our coin is the double-headed coin.",
    "solution": "Let $p_n$ be the probability that given we observe $n$ consecutive heads, our coin is the double-headed coin. Let $H_n$ be the event that $n$ consecutive heads are observed and $D$ be the event that we selected the double-headed coin. We want $p_n = \\mathbb{P}[D \\mid H_n] = \\dfrac{\\mathbb{P}[D \\cap H_n]}{\\mathbb{P}[H_n]}$ by the definition of conditional probability. On the numerator, we can use the definition of conditional probability again to receive $\\mathbb{P}[D \\mid H_n] = \\mathbb{P}[H_n \\mid D]\\mathbb{P}[D]$. The probability of selecting the double-headed coin is $\\dfrac{1}{20}$. Given we select the double-headed coin, we will flip any amount of heads consecutively with probability $1$, so $\\mathbb{P}[H_n \\mid D] = 1$. On the denominator, we need to condition on whether or not we receive the double-headed coin. Thus, $$\\mathbb{P}[H_n] = \\mathbb{P}[H_n \\mid D]\\mathbb{P}[D] + \\mathbb{P}[H_n \\mid D^c]\\mathbb{P}[D^c]$$ We already calculated the first term in the numerator. For the second term, we know $\\mathbb{P}[D^c] = 1 - \\mathbb{P}[D] = \\dfrac{19}{20}$. Then, $\\mathbb{P}[H_n \\mid D^c] = \\dfrac{1}{2^n}$, as we flip a heads on a fair coin with probability $\\dfrac{1}{2}$ in each turn. Therefore, $\\mathbb{P}[H_n] = \\dfrac{1}{20} + \\dfrac{19}{20 \\cdot 2^n}$. Therefore, $p_n = \\dfrac{\\frac{1}{20}}{\\frac{1}{20} + \\frac{19}{20 \\cdot 2^n}} = \\dfrac{1}{1 + \\frac{19}{2^n}}$. Our goal is to find the smallest $n$ such that $p_n > \\dfrac{19}{20}$. This means that $\\dfrac{1}{1 + \\frac{19}{2^n}} > \\dfrac{19}{20}$. Multiplying by the denominator on both sides yields $1 > \\dfrac{19}{20} + \\dfrac{361}{20 \\cdot 2^n}$. Multiplying by $20 \\cdot 2^n$ on both sides yields $2^n > 361$, which occurs for $n \\geq 9$.

One can verify that the expected value in this case (by plugging into the expected value equation previously) is $p_2 - 1$. However, as a probability is at most one $1$, unless $p_2 = 1$, Bob has a strictly negative expected value. Similarly, by plugging in $p_1 = \\dfrac{4}{9}$, one can find the expected value to be $-p_2$. Therefore, unless $p_2 = 0$, Bob once again has a strictly negative expected value.

This can also be proved with induction, and this will be left as an exercise to the reader. The next aspect is regarding the number of places and takes. If there are $p$ places, then there must be $100-p$ takes, and we know that the $p$ places must occur before the $100-p$ takes. In order to find the value of $p$, we can calculate at what position does adding an additional place action not improve our expected payoff. Consider the $p$-th action where $1 < p < 100$ and where this is the last place before we begin taking, or the next action ($p+1$) will be the last pace before we begin taking. What is the expected value of the game if action $p$ is the last place? There are $p$ dollars in aggregate and we have $100-p$ takes. Our expected payoff will be $p \\times \\sum_{i=1} ^{100-p} \\frac{1}{2^i}$, which can be seen from the linearity of expectation- at every take, we will take half of what is remaining on average. What is the expected value of the game if action $p+1$ is the last place? There are $p+1$ dollars in aggregate and we have $100-(p+1)$ takes. Thus, our expected payoff is $(p+1) \\times \\sum_{i=1} ^{100-p-1} \\frac{1}{2^i}$. We are looking for the largest value of $p$ such that the payoff where the $p$-th place is the last place is greater the payoff where the incremental $p+1$-th place is the last place. Thus:$$p \\sum_{i=1} ^{100-p} \\frac{1}{2^i} > (p+1) \\sum_{i=1} ^{100-p-1} \\frac{1}{2^i}p \\sum_{i=1} ^{100-p} \\frac{1}{2^i} > p \\sum_{i=1} ^{99-p} \\frac{1}{2^i} + \\sum_{i=1} ^{99-p} \\frac{1}{2^i}\\frac{p}{2^{100-p}} > \\sum_{i=1} ^{99-p} \\frac{1}{2^i}$$$\\sum_{i=1} ^{99-p} \\frac{1}{2^i}$ approaches 1, and thus $p > 2^{100-p} \\Rightarrow p > 93$. With 94 places, the expected payoff is $94 \\sum_{i=1} ^{6} \\frac{1}{2^i} \\approx 92.5$. To check this is the maximum payoff, we can look at the 93 and 95 placing cases. With 93 places, the expected payoff is $93 \\sum_{i=1} ^{7} \\frac{1}{2^i} \\approx 92.3$. With 95 places, the expected payoff is $95 \\sum_{i=1} ^{5} \\frac{1}{2^i} \\approx 92.0$. Both surrounding values are less than our expected payoff, and hence the optimal number of times we should place is 94 with an expected payoff of $\\frac{2961}{32} \\approx 92.5$.",

The event that at least one of the random variables is in this interval is the complement of the event that all $n$ of the random variables are outside this interval. This latter probability is much easier to compute, as we have intersections of events now instead of unions. Therefore, the probability of the complement is $1-p_n$, so we want to find the smallest $n$ such that $1 - p_n \\leq 0.01$. Now, we want to find an expression for $1 - p_n$, the probability of the complement. If the complement occurs, none of the $n$ IID random variables are in $(0.48,0.52)$.

As all of the random variables have identical distributions, we can evaluate one of the probabilities and raise it to the $n$th power, so this is $(\\mathbb{P}[X_1 \\notin (0.48,0.52)])^n$. The probability $X_1$ is in $(0.48,0.52)$ is just $\\dfrac{0.04}{1} = 0.04$.

Consider $abc - bca$. We will show that in fact any three digit integer $abc$ divisible by $37$ will automatically have the other two forms divisible by $37$ as well. Let $abc$ be an integer divisible by 37. Then $abc = 100a + 10b + c$ by expanding out the digits. For the purposes of this solution, we will prove that if $abc$ is divisible by $37$, then $bca$ also is. The proof for $cab$ is also very similar. By expanding digits again, $bca = 100b + 10c - a$. We have that $$abc - bca = (100a + 10b + c) - (100b + 10c + a) = 99a - 90b - 9c = -9(-11a + 10b + c)$$ Note that the form of the interior parenthesis is the same as it was originally but we have $-11a$ instead of $100a$. The difference between these is $-9 \\cdot 111a = -999a$. As $999$ is divisible by $37$, we can subtract $999a$ and get that $abc - bca \\equiv -9(100a + 10b + c)$ in mod $37$. However, $abc = 100a + 10b + c$ is divisible by 37 by assumption, so $abc - bca \\equiv 0$ in mod $37$. As $abc$ is divisible by $37$, this implies $bca$ is also divisible by $37$.

In other words, how many non-negative integer values of $k$ are there such that $37k \\leq 1000$. We have that $999$ is divisible by $37$ from before and $999 = 37 \\cdot 27$.

This is because there is a probability of $\\frac{E_{n-1}}{n - 1}$ that the $n$-th free throw attempt is made, increasing the total by 1. Simplifying the expression, we find $E_n = \\frac{n}{n-1} E_{n-1}$. Note that $E_3 = \\frac{3}{2}$. The recurrence relation can be rewritten in terms of $n$: $E_n = \\frac{n}{2}$. So, for $n = 100$, we have $E_{100} = 50$. This can also be seen by the first iteration of this question, as our total throw we make is uniform on $\\{1,2,\\dots,99\\}$, which has mean $50$.",

    "solution": "We are going to solve this more generally for $n$ consecutive heads. Let $f_{k}$ be the expected number flips of the coin needed to obtain $n$ heads when you have $0 \\leq k \\leq n$ heads consecutively obtained already. Our boundary condition is that $f_n = 0$, as you already have all $n$ heads obtained. We can see that $f_{n-1} = \\dfrac{1}{2} \\cdot 1 + \\dfrac{1}{2} \\cdot (1 + f_0) = 1 + \\dfrac{1}{2}f_0$, as with probability $1/2$, you reach $n$ heads, and with probability $1/2$, you start over.

We begin by assigning the last $k$ cherries as purple and the $k+1$-th cherry from the end as red. We are left with $m - 1$ red cherries and $n - k$ purple cherries to order however we'd like.

    "hint": "Let $m$ be the age of the middle child, $s$ be the spacing between the children's births, and $d$ be the age of the dad. Then our condition says that $(m-4s)^2 + (m-3s)^2 + \\dots + m^2 + (m+s)^2 + \\dots + (m+4s)^2 = d^2$. Try seeing what the dad's age must be divisible by.",
    "solution": "Let $m$ be the age of the middle child, $s$ be the spacing between the children's births, and $d$ be the age of the dad. Then our condition says that $(m-4s)^2 + (m-3s)^2 + \\dots + m^2 + (m+s)^2 + \\dots + (m+4s)^2 = d^2$. After expanding and cancelling, this reduces to $d^2 = 9m^2 + 60s^2$. Since the RHS is a multiple of $3$, we have that $3 \\mid d^2$, which means $3 \\mid d$. Therefore, let $d = 3r$ for an integer $r$. This means that $9r^2 = 9m^2 + 60s^2$, which equivalent is $(r-m)(r+m) = \\dfrac{20}{3}s^2$. Since the LHS is an integer, this means that $3 \\mid s$ as well. For the youngest child to be born, we must have that $m - 4s \\geq 0$, which means $m \\geq 4s$. Therefore, we have that $d^2 \\geq 9(4s)^2 + 60s^2 = 204s^2 \\geq (14s)^2$. Therefore, $d \\geq 14s$. Since $3 \\mid s$ and $d \\geq 60$, we must have that $s = 0, 3$. Since they are not of the same age, $s = 3$. Plugging this in, we have that $(r-m)(r+m) = 60$. We now need to find factorizations of $60$ that have an integer midpoint, as the midpoint of $r-m$ and $r+m$ is $r$. Namely, we see that $10\\cdot 6$ and $30 \\cdot 2$ both have integer midpoints. If we select the former, then $r = 8$ and $m = 2$, meaning that the middle child has age $2$. As $s = 3$, we would get some negative ages. Therefore, we must have that the midpoint is $r = 16$ and $m = 14$. This is now consistent, as the children would be aged $2,5,8,11,14,17,20,23,$ and $26$. Since the father's age is $3r$, we get that the father is aged $3 \\cdot 16 = 48$.",

    "solution": "Because of the layout and symmetry of squares, we only need to consider if the coin fits in a 2 inch by 2 inch square.

Given the radius of the coin is $0.5$ inches, it canât be any closer than $0.5$ inches to any edge of the square. This gives a total area that the center can land in of $(2-0.5-0.5)^2 = 1$ square inch. The total area of the square (and thus total area that the center of the coin can land in) is $2^2=4$ square inches. This gives us the answer of $\\frac{1}{4}$ = $0.25$.",

Each orb is attached to adjacent orbs by a chain link. At each time step, one of the remaining links is going to be uniformly at random selected and cut. As a result, all the orbs below that link will fall and shatter. What is the expected number of cuts needed until orb 1 is the only remaining orb?",
    "hint": "Let $a_n$ be the expected number of cuts needed with $n$ links. Condition on the position of the first cut to derive a recurrence relation for $a_n$ and then consider the difference $a_n - a_{n-1}$.",
    "solution": "We are going to solve this for the general case of when there are $n$ links. Let $a_n$ be the expected number of cuts needed with $n$ links. We want to find a recurrence relation for $a_n$. To do this, let's consider what happens after the first cut. If we cut at link $k$, $1 \\leq k \\leq n$, where link $1$ connects orbs $1$ and $2$, then this means we have $k-1$ links above it still standing. Thus, we have added $1$ to our count and want to now find the same expectation but starting from $k-1$ links instead of $n$. Mathematically, this means that $a_n = \\displaystyle \\dfrac{1}{n} \\sum_{k=1}^n (1 + a_{k-1})$, as with probability $\\dfrac{1}{n}$, we cut each given link on the first step. This is just Law of Total Expectation above, where we have conditioned on the position of the first cut. We index shift this sum by $1$ to get $a_n = \\dfrac{1}{n} \\displaystyle \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (1 + a_k) = 1 + \\dfrac{1}{n} \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_k$. Now, consider $a_n - a_{n-1}$. Using the recurrence relation above, we obtain that $$a_n - a_{n-1} = \\displaystyle 1 + \\dfrac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}a_k - \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{k=0}^{n-2}a_k\\right) = \\dfrac{1}{n} a_{n-1} + \\left(\\dfrac{1}{n} - \\dfrac{1}{n-1}\\right)\\sum_{k=0}^{n-2} a_k$$ Note that $\\dfrac{1}{n} - \\dfrac{1}{n-1} = -\\dfrac{1}{n(n-1)}$, so the above reduces to $$a_n - a_{n-1} = \\displaystyle \\dfrac{1}{n}a_{n-1} - \\dfrac{1}{n}\\left[\\dfrac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{k=0}^{n-2}a_k\\right]$$ The term in brackets is just $a_{n-1} - 1$ by our original recurrence relation. Therefore, $a_n - a_{n-1} = \\dfrac{1}{n}a_{n-1} - \\dfrac{1}{n}(a_{n-1} - 1) = \\dfrac{1}{n}$. Rearranging, $a_n = a_{n-1} + \\dfrac{1}{n}$. Our initial condition on this that makes physical sense is that $a_1 = 1$, as we only have one link to select from and we cut it on our first trial. With this initial condition, we can recurse and clearly see that $$a_n = a_{n-1} + \\dfrac{1}{n} = a_{n-2} + \\dfrac{1}{n-1} + \\dfrac{1}{n} = \\dots = a_1 + \\dfrac{1}{2} + \\dots + \\dfrac{1}{n} = \\sum_{k=1}^n \\dfrac{1}{k}$$ Therefore, this is our solution for general $n$, and our specific case is when $n = 6$, as we have $6$ links.

When two parallel planes cut a sphere, the surface of the sphere between the two planes is called a zone. The theorem states that the zone is proportional to the distance between the planes. This means that our coin should be $\\dfrac{1}{3}$ as thick as the sphere's diameter. In this case, the \"planes\" are the head and tail faces of the coin, as we inscribe our cylinder into a sphere. The question here is how thick is the sphere? Let's call the radius $R$. The Pythagorean Theorem gives that $$R^2 = 1^2 + \\left(\\dfrac{R}{3}\\right)^2$$ This is because the distance from the center of the coin to the upper face is the radius of the sphere. Additionally, we know that the radius of the coin is $1$ and the thickness (height) of the coin is $\\dfrac{R}{3}$ from before. Solving this yields $R = \\dfrac{3}{\\sqrt{8}}$. However, we want $\\dfrac{1}{3}(2R) = \\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$. We want $2R$ because that is the diameter, and hence how thick the coin should be. Our answer is $k = 2$.",

At each step, the particle moves from position $i$ to position $i+1$ with probability $p$, while the probability it moves from $i$ to $i-1$ is $1-p$. If $p = 1/3$, find the probability the particle ever reaches position $1$.",
    "hint": "Use Law of Total Probability to condition on what happens at the first step.",
    "solution": "We are going to solve this for more general $p$. Let $x_1$ be the probability that the particle ever reaches position $1$. The key is to condition on the move at the first step. If the particle moves right, which occurs with probability $p$, then position $1$ is reached. Otherwise, the particle reaches position $-1$. From $-1$, the particle first needs to reach $0$ again, which occurs with probability $x_1$, and then from there, reach position $1$, which occurs with probability $x_1$ as well. Therefore, given the particle moves left, the probability it reaches position $1$ is $x_1^2$. This gives rise to the equation $$x_1 = p + (1-p)x_1^2$$ We can solve for this quadratic in $x_1$ to get that $x_1 = 1, \\dfrac{p}{1-p}$. Since $x_1 \\leq 1$, we know that for $p \\geq 1/2$, $x_1 = 1$, as the other root would be larger than $1$. For $p < 1/2$, the random walk is biased down, so it is not probability $1$ that the particle ever reaches $1$. This argument can be made more rigorous using more mathematically advanced tools, but those are not of concern here. Therefore, the answer for $p < 1/2$ is $\\dfrac{p}{1-p}$. Since $p = 1/3$ in this question, our answer is $\\dfrac{1/3}{1-1/3} = \\dfrac{1}{2}$.",

    "solution": "First, we are going to calculate $d(e^{\\kappa t}X_t)$. By the product rule, we have that $$d(e^{\\kappa t}X_t) = \\kappa e^{\\kappa t} X_tdt + e^{\\kappa t} dX_t = \\kappa e^{\\kappa t} X_t + e^{\\kappa t} \\left(\\kappa(\\theta - X_t)dt - \\sigma \\sqrt{X_t} dW_t\\right)$$ Distributing everything, we get the first term cancels with the $-\\kappa X_t dt$ term inside the parentheses, so we are left with $$d(e^{\\kappa t} X_t) = \\kappa \\theta e^{\\kappa t} dt - \\sigma e^{\\kappa t} \\sqrt{X_t} dW_t$$ We can use this to get $e^{\\kappa t}X_t$ very simply by integrating both sides. Namely, $$e^{\\kappa t}X_t - X_0 = \\displaystyle \\int_0^t \\kappa \\theta e^{\\kappa s} ds - \\int_0^t \\sigma e^{\\kappa s}\\sqrt{X_s} dW_s$$ Rearranging to isolate $X_t$, we have that $$X_t = X_0e^{-\\kappa t} + \\displaystyle \\int_0^t \\kappa \\theta e^{\\kappa(s - t)}ds - \\int_0^t \\sigma e^{\\kappa(s-t)}\\sqrt{X_s}dW_s$$ Now, we know that $X_0 = x$, so we can substitute that in. In addition, the second integral is Ito and the function inside is \"sufficiently nice\" to conclude that the mean of it is $0$. Thus, $$\\mathbb{E}[X_T] = xe^{-\\kappa T} + \\displaystyle \\int_0^T \\kappa \\theta e^{\\kappa(s - T)} ds = xe^{-\\kappa T} + \\theta e{-\\kappa T} e^{\\kappa s} \\Big|_0^T = xe^{-\\kappa T} + \\theta\\left(1 - e^{-\\kappa T}\\right)$$ Evaluating this at the specific values, our expectation evaluates to $5e^{-2} + 2(1 - e^{-2}) = 2 + 3e^{-2}$.

The events $A_i$ are not mutually exclusive, so we need to use inclusion-exclusion here to calculate this probability. As all of the balls are exchangeable, all individual probabilities and intersection probabilities are the same regardless of which intersection we consider. Therefore, by the inclusion-exclusion formula, we have that $$\\mathbb{P}\\left[\\displaystyle\\bigcup_{i=1}^r A_i\\right] = \\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^r (-1)^{i+1} \\binom{n}{i}\\mathbb{P}\\left[\\displaystyle\\bigcap_{m=1}^i A_m\\right]$$ We get the $\\displaystyle \\binom{n}{i}$ term from the fact that there are $\\displaystyle {n \\choose i}$ ways to select $i$ of the $n$ balls to be in common to everyone. The $(-1)^{i+1}$ term comes from the inclusion-exclusion formula itself. All that remains is to compute the intersection probability. The event $\\displaystyle \\bigcap_{m=1}^i A_m$ means that all of the first $i$ balls are in common to all $k$ people selecting. Therefore, fix those $i$ balls. We now need to select $r-i$ balls from the remaining $n-i$ in the urn per person, which can be done in $\\displaystyle \\binom{n-i}{r-i}$ ways. The total number of ways to select $r$ balls from $n$ is $\\displaystyle \\binom{n}{r}$, so the probability that any individual person selects the first $i$ balls is $$\\dfrac{\\displaystyle \\binom{n-i}{r-i}}{\\displaystyle \\binom{n}{r}}$$ As this needs to be done for all $k$ people, we raise the previous term to the $k$th power. Therefore, we get our final answer of $$p(k,n,r) = \\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^r (-1)^{i+1} \\binom{n}{i}\\left[\\dfrac{\\displaystyle \\binom{n-i}{r-i}}{\\displaystyle \\binom{n}{r}}\\right]^k$$ Plugging in the respective values, we get that $$p(4,17,5) = 103566035/840373563 \\approx 0.123$$",

If $p = 2/3$, find the variance of the number of steps until the particle reaches $1$. If the answer is infinite, answer $-1$.",
    "hint": "Use Law of Total Expectation on $\\mathbb{E}[T_1^2]$ and use prior results.",

We use Law of Total Expectation to condition on what happens at the first step. If the particle moves right at the first step, which occurs with probability $p$, then $T_1 = 1$, as the particle has hit $1$. Therefore, in this case, $T_1^2 = 1$ as well. Otherwise, with probability $1-p$, the particle moves left. The number of steps in this would be $1 + T_0 + T_1$, where $T_0$ is the number of steps needed to go from $-1$ to $0$.

    "hint": "Impose an ordering with $a \\leq b \\leq c \\leq d \\leq e$. What do you know about $4$ and $22$ now in terms of this ordering you imposed?",
    "solution": "We can impose an ordering with $a \\leq b \\leq c \\leq d \\leq e$. We then know that $a+b = 5$ and $d + e = 22$, as the smallest two integers must add up to the smallest sum and the two largest integers must add up to the largest sum. Additionally, we have that every single of the $a,b,c,d,$ and $e$ appears in $4$ of the $10$ pairwise sums, as each integer is added up to every other integer but itself. Therefore, if we sum up all the values in the list, the result is $4 \\cdot (a + b + c + d + e)$. Adding these integers up yields $5 + 11 + 11 + 13 + 13 + 14 + 16 + 19 + 22 + 22 = 146$, so $4 \\cdot (a + b + c + d + e) = 146$. However, we know $a + b = 5$ and $d + e = 22$, so we can get that $$4\\cdot (5 + c + 22) = 146 \\iff c = 9.5$$ The trick now is to note that by the ordering we have, $a+c$ must be the second smallest sum possible after $a+b$, so we have that $a+c = 11$, meaning $a = 1.5$. Since we know $a+b = 5$, we get that $b = 3.5$. By similar logic, we know that the second largest sum after $d+e$ is $c + e$, so we know that $22 = c + e$, meaning that $e = 12.5$. Lastly, since $d + e = 22$ as well, we know $d = c = 9.5$. Putting it all together, we obtained the solution $$(a,b,c,d,e) = (1.5,3.5,9.5,9.5,12.5)$$ Therefore, $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + e^2 = \\dfrac{3^2 + 7^2 + 19^2 + 19^2 + 25^2}{2^2} = \\dfrac{1405}{4}$",

    "solution": "We are going to use the result of Voter Mayhem (often called the \"Ballot Theorem\"). We can rephrase the question as follows: What is the probability that exactly $n$ heads and $n$ tails occur in $2n$ flips AND there are always strictly more heads than tails until the last flip. Let $H$ be the event that $n$ heads and $n$ tails occur in $2n$ flips and $M$ be the event that there are always more heads and tails until the last flip. We have that $\\mathbb{P}[H \\cap M] = \\mathbb{P}[M \\mid H]\\mathbb{P}[H]$. $\\mathbb{P}[H]$ is quite easy to compute, as we can use a binomial random variable PMF.

We can condition on the parity of the last coin. If it is tails, which occurs with probability $1-p$, then the probability is $P_{n,n-1}$, where the heads must be ahead the entire time. If it is tails, which occurs with probability $p$, then the probability is $P_{n,n-1}$ as well, where the tails must be ahead the entire time. Therefore, adding the two cases up, the probability is $\\mathbb{P}[M \\mid H] = P_{n,n-1} = \\dfrac{1}{2n-1}$. Therefore $$\\mathbb{P}[M \\cap H] = \\dfrac{\\displaystyle \\binom{2n}{n}p^n(1-p)^n}{2n-1}$$ Evaluating this with $p = 1/3$ and $n = 5$, we get the answer of approximately $0.0152$.",

    "hint": "In terms of the random variables, write out the statements needed. Condition on $\\alpha$ and use the independence of $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$.",
    "solution": "From Circular Slice I, we know that the probability that the two regions are disjoint is $\\dfrac{1}{6}$. Therefore, the probability they are not disjoint (i.e. intersect at least once) is $\\dfrac{5}{6}$. Now, we need to compute the probability that they intersect at exactly one part. We know the probability they are disjoint is $\\dfrac{1}{6}$. Thus, we just need to find the probability that they intersect at possible parts (the endpoints of $0$ radians and $\\theta_1$ radians). Just as in Circular Slice I, we will treat these as Unif$(0,1)$ random variables instead of Unif$(0,2\\pi)$ random variables by scaling them down. For there to be an intersection at the left end, we need $\\alpha < \\theta_1$. This is because then the start of the blue region will still be in the red region. To have an intersection at the right endpoint i.e. at proportion $1$ of the circle, we need $\\alpha + \\theta_2 > 1$. This is because this arc needs to wrap back around to the point $(1,0)$. Therefore, to find the probability of 2 intersections, we are looking for $\\mathbb{P}[\\theta_1 > \\alpha, \\theta_2 > 1 - \\alpha]$. Similar to the previous question, we will need to condition on the value of $\\alpha$ to obtain this probability. This means that $$\\mathbb{P}[\\theta_1 > \\alpha, \\theta_2 > 1 - \\alpha] = \\displaystyle \\int_0^1 \\mathbb{P}[\\theta_1 > \\alpha, \\theta_2 > 1 - \\alpha \\mid \\alpha = x]f_{\\alpha}(x)dx$$ Evaluating the interior probability, this becomes $\\mathbb{P}[\\theta_1 > x,\\theta_2 > 1-x] = \\mathbb{P}[\\theta_1 > x]\\mathbb{P}[\\theta_2 > 1-x] = x(1-x)$. Therefore, the integral is $\\displaystyle \\int_0^1 x(1-x)dx = \\dfrac{1}{6}$. Combining all of the above, we now see the probability of exactly one purple region is $1 - \\dfrac{1}{6} - \\dfrac{1}{6} = \\dfrac{2}{3}$, so by the formula for conditional probability, given that there was at least one purple region, the probability there is exactly one is $\\dfrac{\\frac{2}{3}}{\\frac{5}{6}} = \\dfrac{4}{5}$.",

Suppose we are ordering 3 $E$s and 9 $L$s. Consider any arbitrary ordering of the 3 $E$s and 9 $L$s. If the ordering allows all spots to be filled by 3:00 PM, then we can assign Andy to 3 of the 9 $L$s. So, the probability that Andy gets a parking spot conditioned on the event that all spots are filled by 3:00 PM is $\\frac{1}{3}$. In the other case, the probability should intuitively be less than $\\frac{1}{3}$, because not all parking spots can be filled. For example, consider the following ordering: $LLLLLLLLLEEE$. No matter which $L$ we assign Andy to, there is no chance that he will find an empty parking spot. Now that we've gained a bit more intuition, we can now properly divide our problem up into 4 cases: (A) there are 3 empty parking spots at 3:00 PM, (B) there are 2 empty parking spots at 3:00 PM, (C) there is 1 empty parking spot at 3:00 PM, and (D) there are no empty parking spots at 3:00 PM.

Case A: There are 3 empty parking spots at 3:00 PM. The only way for there to be 3 empty parking spots at 3:00 PM is with the following ordering: $LLLLLLLLLEEE$. This ordering occurs with probability $\\frac{1}{220}$.

One way for this to occur is if the last two letters are both $E$, of which there are $\\binom{10}{9} = 10$ possible orderings. But this includes the case where the last three letters are all $E$, so we must subtract $1$. In addition, $LLLLLLLLEELE$, $LLLLLLLLEEEL$ work. In this case, there is exactly one $L$ that Andy may be assigned to such that he is able to park. Hence, \\[\\begin{aligned} \\mathbb{P}\\left(S \\cap B\\right) &= \\mathbb{P}\\left(S \\,|\\, B\\right) \\mathbb{P}(B) \\\\ &= \\frac{1}{9} \\cdot \\frac{11}{220} \\\\ &= \\frac{1}{180}\\end{aligned}\\] Case C: There is 1 empty parking spot at 3:00 PM. One way for this to occur is if the last letter is an $E$, which occurs in $\\binom{11}{2} = 55$ orderings. But this includes the case where two or more of the final letters are $E$, as well as the case $LLLLLLLLEELE$, so we must subtract $10 + 1 = 11$. In addition, $LLLLLLLEEELL$, $LLLLLLLEELEL$, as well as any ordering ending with $EEL$ except for the ordering ending with $EEEL$ (there are $\\binom{9}{8} - 1= 8$ such orderings) work.

Therefore, we have that $\\rho(X+Y,X-Y) = \\dfrac{\\sigma_X^2 - \\sigma_Y^2}{(\\sigma_X+\\sigma_Y)|\\sigma_X - \\sigma_Y|} = \\dfrac{\\sigma_X - \\sigma_Y}{|\\sigma_X - \\sigma_Y|} = -1$. We get the $-1$ from the condition that $\\sigma_Y > \\sigma_X$, so the numerator is negative. Another way to see this is that if $X$ and $Y$ are perfectly correlated, then $Y = aX + b$ for some constants $a$ and $b$. Since $\\sigma_Y > \\sigma_X$, it must be the case that $|a| > 1$. Therefore, $X+Y = X(1+a) + b$ and $X-Y = X(1-a) + b$. As $|a| > 1$, one of the constants between $1+a$ and $1-a$ is positive and one is negative. Therefore, as these are both linear transformation of $X$ with opposing signs, they must have correlation $-1$. Note that this argument does not depend at all on whether or not the correlation of $X$ and $Y$ is $-1$ or $1$.",

We essentially are creating a one-to-one mapping between the kegs and binary sequences of length $10$, so this means that $n = 2^{10} = 1024$ is the maximum number of kegs we can test.

    "solution": "From geometry, we know that the volume of a cone with height $h$ and base radius $r$ is $\\dfrac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 h$. Therefore, as $r = 1$ and $h = 2$ here, the volume of this cone is $\\dfrac{2\\pi}{3}$. We also know that the radius decreases linearly with height from the bottom. In other words, we know that the radius as a function of the height $x$ from the base, say $r(x)$, is linear. This means it is in the form $r(x) = c_0 + c_1 x$. Since $r(0) = 1$ (we are at the base) and $r(2) = 0$ (we are at the tip), we get that $r(x) = 1 - \\dfrac{x}{2}$ by solving the resultant linear system. Consider the complement of our event, which is that we are above a height $1$ from the base. This region is another conic region. However, the base radius is now $1 - \\dfrac{1}{2} = \\dfrac{1}{2}$ and our height is $1$, so the volume of the conic region that is complementary to our region of interest is $\\dfrac{1}{3} \\cdot \\pi \\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)^2 \\cdot 1 = \\dfrac{\\pi}{12}$. Therefore, as our selection of the point is uniform throughout the volume of the cone, the probability that we select a point above height $1$ from the base is $\\dfrac{\\frac{1}{12}}{\\frac{2}{3}} = \\dfrac{1}{8}$.

The key here is to condition on whether or not $A \\leq 20$. Namely, this means $$\\mathbb{P}[W] = \\mathbb{P}[W \\mid A \\leq 20] \\mathbb{P}[A \\leq 20] + \\mathbb{P}[W \\mid A > 20] \\mathbb{P}[A > 20]$$ We can quickly see that $\\mathbb{P}[A \\leq 20] = \\dfrac{2}{3}$, as this accounts for $20$ of $30$ equally-likely values. If $A > 20$, then clearly Alice wins regardless of what Bob obtains, so $\\mathbb{P}[W \\mid A > 20] = 1$. If $A \\leq 20$, then we are really rolling $2$ independent $20-$sided fair dice. Namely, to compute $\\mathbb{P}[W \\mid A \\leq 20]$, we see that the probability of a tie is $\\dfrac{1}{20}$, as there are $20$ values they can agree upon out of $20^2 = 400$ outcomes. Therefore, the probability the two rolls are different is $\\dfrac{19}{20}$. Because of the fact that the two dice are symmetric, $\\mathbb{P}[A > B] = \\dfrac{1}{2} \\cdot \\dfrac{19}{20} = \\dfrac{19}{40}$, as when the two rolls are not the same, it is equally-likely whether $A > B$ or $A < B$. Combining these all together, we see that $\\mathbb{P}[W] = \\dfrac{1}{3} \\cdot 1 + \\dfrac{2}{3} \\cdot \\dfrac{19}{40} = \\dfrac{39}{60}$. Now, Bob is going to roll again whenever $\\mathbb{P}[W \\mid B = b] > \\mathbb{P}[W] = \\dfrac{39}{60}$. This is because he wants to minimize Alice's chance of winning. It is easy to see that $\\mathbb{P}[W \\mid B = b] = 1-\\dfrac{b}{30}$, as Alice just needs to roll a value of at least $b+1$. We just need to find the maximum value of $b$, say $b^*$, such that $\\mathbb{P}[W \\mid B = b] = 1 - \\dfrac{b}{30} > \\dfrac{39}{60}$. Solving this inequality, we get that $b \\leq 10.5$, so $b^* = 10$ is the maximum value that Bob rolls again. Let $W_1$ be the event that Alice wins in this new game where Bob can roll again. We have that $$\\mathbb{P}[W_1] = \\mathbb{P}[W] + \\dfrac{10}{20}\\left(\\mathbb{P}[W] - \\mathbb{P}[W \\mid B \\leq 10]\\right)$$ We get this because of the fact that Bob rolls again with probability $\\dfrac{1}{2}$, which is when he rolls at most $10$. Then, the probability Alice wins is going to change by $\\mathbb{P}[W] - \\mathbb{P}[W \\mid B \\leq 10]$. To calculate $\\mathbb{P}[W \\mid B \\leq 10]$, this is simply just average all the cases where $B = b$ for $1 \\leq b \\leq 10$, as when $B \\leq 10$, the value is uniformly distributed on the first $10$ positive integers.

    "solution": "We can plot the payout and see that the maximum payout is $4$ when $S_T < 20$. So, the best upper-bound at time-$T$ is $4$. By no arbitrage, this relationship must hold to time $t = 0$. Since this is a constant, this acts like a bond and we should apply the discount factor. This gives us our answer of $V_0 = 4 * 0.9 = 3.6$. This then gives us another no-arbitrage relationship for puts of different strikes: $$P(K_2) - P(K_1) \\le (K_2 - K_1)B$$ where $K_2 > K_1$ and $B$ is the discount factor.",

    "task": "$10$ contestants are arranged into a line on a bridge and in front of them lay ten left tiles and ten right tiles side by side. In order to cross the bridge, the contestants must cross $10$ tiles, and at each step, the person in front must pick either the left or right tile to step on. However, for each left & right tile pair, there is exactly one sturdy tile and one faulty tile, but the contestants cannot tell them apart. The contestants cross the bridge in their assigned order with the first person picking either the left or right tile, and continuing to lead unless either a faulty tile is picked (resulting in elimination) or person one reaches the other side. If the first person is eliminated before reaching the other side, the person second in line assumes the lead picking until he/she is eliminated (or reaches the other side), and so on. The winner of the game is the $\\textit{first}$ person to reach the other side. Let $p_i$ be the probability that the $i$th contestant in the line wins. Find ${ \\underset i \\sup} \\hspace{3pt} p_i$.",
    "hint": "The probability of a person $i$ winning is equal to the probability of everyone before person $i$ failing at some point, and person $i$ getting the remaining ones correct.",
    "solution": "Let's start with person $1$. We know that since they are leading, they must get everything right in order to be the first one across so $$\\mathbb{P}[\\text{1 win}] = \\frac{1}{2^{10}}$$ Next, the only way person $2$ can win is if person $1$ is eliminated before reaching the end, and person $2$ gets the remaining tiles correct. So, suppose person $1$ is eliminated at tile $k \\in \\Z$ where $1 \\leq k \\leq 10$. The probability of person $1$ making to tile $k$ is $$\\underbrace{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{k-1}}_{\\text{k-1 correct}} * \\underbrace{\\frac{1}{2}}_{\\text{last incorrect}}$$ so then the probability of person $2$ winning is getting all remaining ones correct so we have $\\mathbb{P}[\\text{2 win} | \\text{1 ends at k} ] = (\\frac{1}{2})^{10-k}$. Applying conditional probability, we observe that $$\\mathbb{P}[\\text{2 win}] = \\sum_{k=1}^{10} \\mathbb{P}[\\text{2 win} | \\text{1 ends at k} ] \\mathbb{P}[\\text{1 ends at k}] = \\sum_{k=1}^{10}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{10-k} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{k} = 10 * \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{10}$$ Starting to generalize, we consider $\\mathbb{P}[\\text{3 win}]$ and like before, $3$ can win only if both person $1$ and $2$ are eliminated before reaching the end $\\textbf{and}$ person 3 gets the remaining correct. Analyzing as before, let's suppose person $1$ makes it to tile $i$ and person $2$ makes it to tile $j$ with $i < j$ and $i, j \\in \\Z$ where $1 \\leq i, j, \\leq 10$. It follows from the previous argument that $\\mathbb{P}[\\text{1 ends at i}] = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^i$ and $\\mathbb{P}[\\text{2 ends at j} | \\text{1 ends at i} ] = (\\frac{1}{2})^{j-i}$. Now, we see that $$P[\\text{3 win}] = \\sum_{i=1}^{10} \\sum_{j = i+1} ^ {10} \\mathbb{P}[\\text{3 win} | \\text{2 ends at j}] P[\\text{2 ends at j} | \\text{1 ends at i}] P[\\text{1 ends at i}] = {10 \\choose 2} (\\frac{1}{2})^{10}$$ The core idea here is that if we want to determine the $\\mathbb{P}[\\text{i win}]$ this is equivalent to figuring how many ways you can arrange the $i-1$ people before $i$ to fail. Each of these outcomes has equal probability mass of $(\\frac{1}{2})^{10}$. Thus, we have that $\\mathbb{P}[\\text{i win}] = {10 \\choose i-1} (\\frac{1}{2})^{10}$ and we know that ${10 \\choose i-1}$ is maximized when $i-1 =5 \\implies$ person $6$ has the highest probability of winning with a probability of $$\\displaystyle{10 \\choose 6-1} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{10} = \\frac{252}{1024} = \\dfrac{63}{256}$$",

    "task": "Alice and Bob are in Roman times and have $4$ gladiators each. The strengths of each of Alice's gladiators are $1-4$, while Bob's gladiators have strengths $4,5,9,$ and $12$. The tournament is going to consist of Alice and Bob picking gladiators to fight against one another one-at-a-time. Then, the two gladiators fight to the death with no ties. If the two gladiators are of strengths $x$ and $y$, respectively, then the probability that the gladiator with strength $x$ wins is $\\dfrac{x}{x+y}$. The winning gladiator will maintain the same strength after the round is over. Alice is going to pick first for each fight among her remaining gladiators. Afterwards, Bob can select his gladiator (assuming he has one) to go against the one Alice selected. The winner of the tournament is the person who has at least one gladiator left at the end. Does Bob have an optimal strategy $S^*$ such that the probability Bob wins the tournament with strategy $S^*$ is strictly larger than with any other strategy $S \\neq S^*$? If so, answer $1$. If not, answer $0$.",

What is the condition for Bob/Alice to win in terms of the lightbulbs? Why is this equivalent to the original game?",
    "solution": "In this game, instead of giving the strength $x$ gladiator $x$ balls, we will give him a light bulb whose lifetime is $\\text{Exp}(1/x)$ distributed. We select this parameter so the mean is $x$. When two gladiators fight, we turn on their light bulbs, and the one goes out first is the loser. Once a gladiator wins, we immediately turn off his light bulb and then turn it on again when he is chosen for his next fight. The memorylessness property says that the excess life of this bulb (i.e. how long the bulb has left of life) is still exponential with the same parameter, so this is a valid way to encapsulate the constancy of strength after a fight. One can show fairly easily that if $X_1 \\sim \\text{Exp}(\\lambda_1)$ and $X_2 \\sim \\text{Exp}(\\lambda_2)$, then $\\mathbb{P}[X_1 < X_2] = \\dfrac{\\lambda_1}{\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2}$. We apply this with $\\lambda_1 = 1/x$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1/y$ i.e. $X_1$ and $X_2$ respectively represent the light bulbs of gladiators with strengths $x$ and $y$. We thus get that $$\\mathbb{P}[X_1 < X_2] = \\dfrac{1/x}{1/x + 1/y} = \\dfrac{y}{x+y}$$ which represents the probability the strength $y$ gladiator wins, exactly like we wanted! During the tournament, Bob and Alice have one light bulb active at all times. The winner is exactly who has the greater total lighting time (the sum of all time intervals where a gladiator for their team has their light bulb active). Since the exponentials are memoryless, the order of selection is irrelevant. Therefore, there is no optimal strategy.",

    "hint": "How does the probability you roll again related to the other outcomes?",
    "solution": "First we need to find the probability of every outcome. Double $6$s occur with probability $(\\frac{1}{6})^2 = \\frac{1}{36}$. We can count the number of $6$ and non-$6$ combos there are and youâll see there are $10$ ($1$-$5$ on the first die and $6$ on the other with two different orderings). This gives that event a probability of $\\frac{10}{36}$. Since the other event is just a recurrence of these two events, we can normalize the probabilities of the two events we care about. We do this by finding the probability of our target event and divide it with the probability of the non-recurrent events. So the probability of a double $6$s in this case can be updated to $\\dfrac{\\frac{1}{36}}{(\\frac{1}{36} + \\frac{10}{36})} = \\frac{1}{11}$. This gives the probability the game ends in a $6$ and non $6$ of $\\frac{10}{11}$. Finally, we can solve for $x$. The profit equation here is $100\\cdot\\frac{1}{11} - x\\cdot\\frac{10}{11}$ which has to be greater than or equal to $0$. Thus $\\frac{100}{11} \\geq \\frac{10x}{11}$.

Let $X_i$ be the indicator of the event that you roll a $1$ on roll $i$, and $Y_i$ be the indicator of the event that you roll a $5$ on roll $i$. Thus, we have that $X = \\displaystyle \\sum_{i = 1}^n X_i$ and $Y = \\displaystyle \\sum_{i = 1}^n Y_i$. Plugging these in, we get that $$\\text{Cov}(X,Y) = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\displaystyle \\sum_{i = 1}^n X_i\\displaystyle \\sum_{i = 1}^n Y_i\\right] - \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\displaystyle \\sum_{i = 1}^n X_i\\right]\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\displaystyle \\sum_{i = 1}^n Y_i\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\displaystyle \\sum_{i = 1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^n X_iY_j\\right] - \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\displaystyle \\sum_{i = 1}^n X_i\\right]\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\displaystyle \\sum_{i = 1}^n Y_i\\right]$$ Evaluating the two expectations at the end are not difficult. Note that $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\displaystyle \\sum_{i = 1}^n X_i\\right] = \\displaystyle \\sum_{i = 1}^n \\mathbb{E}[X_i]$ by linearity, and $\\mathbb{E}[X_i] = \\mathbb{P}[\\text{roll a one on any given turn}] = \\dfrac{1}{6}$. The similar logic applies to $\\mathbb{E}[Y_i]$, and you also will get $\\dfrac{1}{6}$ for that. Thus, $\\displaystyle \\sum_{i = 1}^n \\dfrac{1}{6} = \\dfrac{n}{6}$, so the second term comes out to be $\\dfrac{n \\cdot n}{6 \\cdot 6} = \\dfrac{n^2}{36}$. Now, for the first sum, we need to be clever. We need to break this up into two sums: $i = j$ and $i \\neq j$. This yields $$\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\displaystyle \\sum_{i = 1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^n X_iY_j\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\displaystyle \\sum_{i\\neq j} X_iY_j + \\sum_{i=1}^n X_iY_i\\right] = \\displaystyle \\sum_{i \\neq j} \\mathbb{E}[X_iY_j] + \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathbb{E}[X_iY_i]$$ Now, let's deal with these sums individually. $\\mathbb{E}[X_iY_i]$ takes the value of the probability that both $X_i$ and $Y_i$ occur. For both $X_i$ and $Y_i$ to occur, one would need to roll BOTH a one and a five on a single turn $i$. There is no chance of being able to do this, so $\\mathbb{E}[X_iY_i] = 0$. Thus, the entire second sum evaluates to $0$. For the first expectation, it takes the value of the probability of both $X_i$ and $Y_j$ occurring. For both to occur, one would need to roll a $1$ on roll $i$ and a $5$ on roll $j$. Since we know $i \\neq j$, this is definitely possible to occur, and since rolls are independent, the probability of this is just $\\dfrac{1}{6} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{6} = \\dfrac{1}{36}$. Thus, the first sum evaluates to $\\displaystyle \\sum_{i \\neq j} \\dfrac{1}{36} = \\dfrac{n(n-1)}{36}$. We get the $n(n-1)$ term from the fact that there were $n^2$ terms before in the sum $(n$ in the outer, $n$ in the inner sum, so $n \\cdot n = n^2)$, and then we remove $n$ of them from that original double sum when separating out the case where $i \\neq j$ from $i = j$, so there are $n^2 -n$ terms in the first sum remaining. Thus, plugging in, we have $\\text{Cov}(X,Y) = \\dfrac{n^2 - n}{36} - \\dfrac{n^2}{36} = -\\dfrac{n}{36}$. Note that there is a much quicker route to this solution: We have that $X + Y \\sim \\text{Binom}(n,1/3)$, as $X+Y$ counts the number of times that either $1$ or $5$ appears, and at least one of these appears per roll with probability $1/3$. The variance of $X+Y$ would therefore be $\\dfrac{2n}{9}$ from the variance formula for binomials. We have that $\\text{Var}(X)$ and $\\text{Var}(Y)$ are both $\\dfrac{5n}{36}$ from the variance of binomial formula. Plugging into the variance of a sum formula, $$\\dfrac{2n}{9} = \\dfrac{5n}{36} + \\dfrac{5n}{36} + 2\\text{Cov}(X,Y)$$ We have that $2\\text{Cov}(X,Y) = -\\dfrac{n}{18}$ after rearranging, meaning that $\\text{Cov}(X,Y) = -\\dfrac{n}{36}$. To find the correlation, $\\sigma_X = \\sigma_Y = \\dfrac{\\sqrt{5n}}{6}$ from the above. Therefore, $$\\rho(X,Y) = \\dfrac{\\text{Cov}(X,Y)}{\\sigma_X\\sigma_Y} = \\dfrac{-\\frac{n}{36}}{\\frac{5n}{36}} = -\\dfrac{1}{5}$$ from the formula for correlation.",

Thinking about this more intuitively, under normal conditions, the greater the volatility ($\\nu$), the more the seller demands in order to protect against big moves against his position. When this volatility is tending to infinity, this means the seller needs near infinite protection in order to justify selling the call.",

    "hint": "When does our contract make money and how much?",
    "solution": "First, we need to see how many combinations of dice rolls land us in profit. Listed in increasing order they are $(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (1,3), (3,1)$. With these combinations, a roll of $(1,1)$ yields a profit of $3$ units ($4-1 = 3$) with a $\\frac{1}{36}$ chance in doing so, a roll of $(1,2)$ or $(2,1)$ yields a profit of $2$ units ($4-2 = 2$) with a $\\frac{2}{36}$ chance in doing so, and a roll of $(1,3)$ or $(3,1)$ yields a profit of $1$ units ($4-3 = 1$) with a $\\frac{2}{36}$ chance in doing so. Putting this all together we have $\\frac{1}{36} \\cdot 3 + \\frac{2}{36} \\cdot 2 + \\frac{2}{36} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{9}{36}$, showing our contract should be priced at $1/4$.",

Since the man was alive in the year $1900$, the death must have been after $1900$. Since the year he died must have been divisible by $30$, the next multiple of $30$ after $1900$ is $1920$. This would imply $x = 64$, which is consistent with the information we have. The year he would have been born in was $29 \\cdot 64 = 1856$, and he lived $64$ years to pass away in $1920$.

We can quickly see that in this finite state game, the banker selecting uniformly at random is not optimal, as to maximize the expected payout, you would select $N$ as your value and your expected payout on the game would be $N$. What we want to do is find a distribution on the positive integers so that the expected payout from the banker is constant regardless of the value that he selects. This would be because of the fact that no matter which probability distribution you select, you would now have constant payout on the game, so you can't do any better by selecting another distribution. If $N$ is the value the banker selects, to have constant expected payout per value, we would need a distribution with PMF in the form $\\mathbb{P}[N = n] = \\dfrac{C}{n^2}$ for positive integers $n$. To find $C$, we note that $\\displaystyle\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\mathbb{P}[N = n] = 1$, so $C \\cdot \\displaystyle \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\dfrac{1}{n^2} = 1$.

    "solution": "We can see here, we have quite an unusual options chain we can take advantage of. As our chains are near inverses of each other, assume the underlying is selling at $\\$175$. Usually, on a chain, when the strike of our call option increases, the call option's value approaches full value, meaning the difference between our prices should be close to the difference in our strike prices. In this example, as our call option increases in strike price, we would expect the prices to get increasingly farther away. In this case, the prices actually start converging, showing our chain is improperly formed. The same is true on the put side, we should see the difference in price increase as the strike price decreases, but again, the opposite is true. In order to take advantage of this, we can use an iron condor strategy. Usually an iron condor is used to take advantage of a neutral market, but in this case, we just care about the large mispricings in the chain.

Then $\\mathbb{E}[X] = 1000\\mathbb{E}[X_1]$ by exchangeability. $\\mathbb{E}[X_1]$ is just the probability $1$ is fixed, which is $\\dfrac{1}{1000}$, as it is equally likely to end in any of the $1000$ spots. To compute $\\mathbb{E}[X^2]$, we expand out the sum squared. Namely, $$\\mathbb{E}[X^2] = \\mathbb{E}[(X_1 + \\dots + X_{1000})^2] = \\sum_{i=1}^{1000} \\mathbb{E}[X_i^2] + \\sum_{i \\neq j} \\mathbb{E}[X_iX_j]$$ The first term is where $i = j$ and the second term is where $i \\neq j$. Note that $X_i^2 = X_i$, as $X_i$ only takes the values $0$ and $1$, so $\\mathbb{E}[X_i^2] = \\dfrac{1}{1000}$. For the second sum, as the $X_i$ random variables are exchangeable, for any $i \\neq j$, $\\mathbb{E}[X_iX_j] = \\mathbb{E}[X_1X_2]$. This expectation is just the probability both $1$ and $2$ are fixed. This probability is just $\\dfrac{1}{1000} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{999}$, as once $1$ is fixed, $2$ goes into spot $2$ with probability $\\dfrac{1}{999}$. Therefore, $\\mathbb{E}[X_1X_2] = \\dfrac{1}{1000} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{999}$. There are $1000$ terms in the first sum, while there are $1000^2 - 1000 = 1000(1000 - 1) = 1000 \\cdot 999$ terms in the second sum.

You may assume without proof the first three moments of $X$ are finite.",
    "hint": "Write down the LOTUS integral for this. Do you note any symmetries?",
    "solution": "To compute the skewness, we must compute a seemingly complicated integral via LOTUS. We use the fact that the mean of this distribution is $\\mu$, which you can clearly see is finite because of the fact that the tails are exponentially decaying and it is even about $\\mu$. Therefore, the mean must be $\\mu$. To compute the skewness, our integral of interest is $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\dfrac{X-\\mu}{\\sigma_X}\\right)^3\\right] = \\dfrac{1}{\\sigma_X^3}\\displaystyle \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} (x-\\mu)^3 \\cdot \\dfrac{\\lambda}{2}e^{-\\lambda |x - \\mu |} dx$.

This new integral becomes $$\\dfrac{\\lambda}{2\\sigma_X^3} \\displaystyle \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} u^3e^{-\\lambda |u|}du$$ This is where the magic takes place. Note that $u^3e^{-\\lambda |u|}$ is odd about $u = 0$ and we are integrating over a symmetric integral about $0$ (namely, the real line). We also know that this integral must be finite since we assume the first three moments of $X$ are finite. Therefore, as this integrand is odd and finite about a symmetric integral, the integral must be $0$.",

The loser must pay the winner the value showing on the winner's die. In the event of a tie, Bob is the winner. Find the expected payout for Alice.",
    "hint": "Let $P$ be the payout, while $A$ and $B$ are the values Alice and Bob roll. The key here is to condition on whether or not $A \\leq 20$.",
    "solution": "Let $P$ be the payout, while $A$ and $B$ are the values Alice and Bob roll. The key here is to condition on whether or not $A \\leq 20$. Namely, by Law of Total Expectation, we have that $$\\mathbb{E}[P] = \\mathbb{E}[P \\mid A \\leq 20] \\mathbb{P}[A \\leq 20] + \\mathbb{E}[P \\mid A > 20]\\mathbb{P}[A > 20]$$ We quickly see that $\\mathbb{P}[A \\leq 20] = \\dfrac{2}{3}$, as this accounts for $20$ of the $30$ values that can appear. The expected payout for Alice in this case would be $0$ if ties were not settled in Bob's favor. Ties happen with probability $\\dfrac{1}{20}$ in this case, as the first roll is completely arbitrary and the second roll just needs to match the first value. Given a tie occurs, it is equally likely to be any of the $20$ values. Therefore, $$\\mathbb{E}[P \\mid A \\leq 20] = -\\dfrac{1 + 20}{2} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{20} = -\\dfrac{21}{40}$$ If $A > 20$, occurring with probability $\\dfrac{1}{3}$, then Alice is guaranteed to win. Her expected payout in this case then is $\\dfrac{21+30}{2} = \\dfrac{51}{2}$, as it is equally-likely to be any of the values $21-30$ given that she is larger than $20$. Combining this, we see that $$\\mathbb{E}[P] = -\\dfrac{21}{40} \\cdot \\dfrac{2}{3} + \\dfrac{51}{2} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{3} = 8.15$$",

    "task": "A farmer wants one male and one female goat for breeding. He goes to Mount Everest to find goats. Each goat is known to be male with probability $\\dfrac{3}{4}$, independent of all other goats.

Then, given the first goat selected is male, with probability $\\dfrac{1}{4}$ on each trial after we get a female goat and then we leave. Therefore, the distribution of the number of trials needed to see the first female goat after the male is selected is $\\text{Geom}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{4}\\right)$, which has mean $4$. Therefore, $\\mathbb{E}[N \\mid M] = 1 + 4 = 5$. We add the one in for the first goat (male) that is selected. Similarly, if the first goat is female, the distribution of the number of goats needed to be selected until getting a male goat is $\\text{Geom}\\left(\\dfrac{3}{4}\\right)$, which has mean $\\dfrac{4}{3}$.

    "solution": "We want to find the expected cards after the first $2$ that we obtain the first ace. Therefore, our first task is to figure out how many cards that aren't ranked $A$ and $2$ show up between cards ranked $A$ or $2$ on average. We have $8$ dividers, which are precisely all of the rank $A$ and $2$ cards. These dividers split our deck up into $9$ regions. There are $44$ cards left that are not ranked $A$ or $2$, so as we have that the regions have equal size in expectation, the expected length of each region is $\\dfrac{44}{9}$. Now, we need to find the expected number of regions that appear between the first $2$ and ace. We now do first ace again on the dividers. We know that one of the $2$s showed up already, so we only have 7 dividers left. We want to find the expected number of $2$s before the first ace, so the aces are our dividers now. The $4$ aces divide up our subset into $5$ regions. We have $3$ $2$s left, so there are on average $\\dfrac{3}{5}$ $2$s per region. However, we already know that one $2$ appeared, so we must add $1$ to the number of regions that there will be. Therefore, our expected number of regions is $\\dfrac{8}{5}$. However, we also need to account for the dividers, as we did not count for them previously when computing $\\dfrac{44}{9}$. The average number of dividers that appear after the first $2$ is $\\dfrac{3}{5}$, so we just add that in above. Putting this all together, the expected number of cards between them is $\\dfrac{44}{9} \\cdot \\dfrac{8}{5} + \\dfrac{3}{5} = \\dfrac{379}{45}$.",

    "hint": "Condition on whether or not the matching pair is the color that has $3$ replicates.",
    "solution": "There are two cases to consider when getting a matching pair: We need to consider whether or not the color that matches is the color that has 3 replicates. This is because the probability that we draw another sock of that same color is different dependent on how many socks of that color are left. The probability that we select a sock on the first draw that just has a pair is $\\dfrac{18}{21} = \\dfrac{6}{7}$. Then, the probability that on the second draw we select a sock of that same color is $\\dfrac{1}{20}$, as we assume this is a color with just the pair. This case yields a net probability of $\\dfrac{6}{7} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{20} = \\dfrac{6}{140}$. The other case is that we select the color with 3 socks, which occurs with probability $\\dfrac{1}{7}$ on the first draw. The probability we draw another sock of that color is $\\dfrac{2}{20}$, as 2 of the 20 remaining socks are of that color. This case yields a net probability of $\\dfrac{1}{7} \\cdot \\dfrac{2}{20} = \\dfrac{2}{140}$. Adding up the cases, our total probability of drawing a pair is $\\dfrac{8}{140} = \\dfrac{2}{35}$.",

    "solution": "We know that $T, G, P \\sim \\text{Geom}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)$ IID, as they are looking for the distribution of the first heads. As these are independent, we can multiply the individual PMFs to get the joint PMF, so the joint PMF is $\\mathbb{P}[T = t, G = g, P = p] = \\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)^t\\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)^g\\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)^p$ for $t,g,p = 1,2,\\dots$. We now need to get a region of summation for this probability. Let's let $t$ be free, so we sum $t$ from $1$ to $\\infty$. Then, we know $G \\geq T$, so we sum over $g = t$ to $\\infty$. After that, we know $P \\geq G$, so we sum inner most from $p = g$ to $\\infty$. Therefore, our sum is $\\displaystyle \\sum_{t = 1}^{\\infty} \\sum_{g = t}^{\\infty} \\sum_{p = g}^{\\infty} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)^t\\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)^g\\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)^p$. As the inner most summation only concerns $p$, we ignore the rest for now. $\\sum_{p = g}^{\\infty} \\dfrac{1}{2^p} = \\dfrac{\\frac{1}{2^g}}{1 - \\frac{1}{2}} = \\dfrac{1}{2^{g-1}}$. Now, our summation is $\\displaystyle \\sum_{t=1}^{\\infty} \\sum_{g = t}^{\\infty} \\dfrac{1}{2^t} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{2^{2g-1}} = \\sum_{t=1}^{\\infty} \\sum_{g = t+1}^{\\infty} \\dfrac{1}{2^{t-1}} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{4^g}$.

Now, our final summation is $\\dfrac{8}{3} \\displaystyle \\sum_{t=1}^{\\infty} \\dfrac{1}{8^t}$ after shoving all the constants to the front. The last sum is simply $\\dfrac{\\frac{1}{8}}{1 - \\frac{1}{8}} = \\dfrac{1}{7}$, so our solution is $\\dfrac{8}{21}$.",

Then $\\displaystyle T = \\sum_{i=0}^{2n-1} X_i$ gives the total number of people that know at least one of their neighbors.

This is just the same as $1 - $ the probability of the complement, which is that they know neither of the people sitting beside them. Since each arrangement is equally likely, the probability that they don't know the person sitting on one side of them is $\\dfrac{2n-1-k}{2n-1}$.

    "task": "Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Daniel need to get across a river. The only way to cross the river is by an old wooden bridge, which holds at most two people at a time. Because it is dark, they can't cross the bridge without a lantern, of which they only have one. Each pair can only walk at the speed of the slower person. They need to get all of them across to the other side as quickly as possible. Alice takes 10 minutes to cross; Bob takes 5 minutes; Charlie takes 2 minutes; Daniel takes 1 minute. What is the minimum time to get all of them across to the other side?",

    "solution": "The key point is to realize that the person returning with the lantern does not have to be from the most recent pairing. Another point to realize is that Alice and Bob should go together, and not in the first crossing- otherwise, one of them has to go back, which will take too long. Therefore, Charlie and Daniel should go across first, which takes two minutes. Then, send Daniel back with the lantern, which takes one minute. Alice and Bob go across, which takes ten minutes. Charlie returns with the lantern, which takes two minutes. Finally, Charlie and Daniel cross again, which takes two minutes, for a total of 17 minutes.",

    "task": "An ant starts at the origin in the plane. At each step, with probability $\\dfrac{1}{4}$, the ant will move one unit north, south, east, or west. What is the probability that the ant returns to the origin before hitting any point on the boundary of the square with vertices at $(\\pm 2, \\pm 2)$?",
    "hint": "Let $p(a,b)$ be the probability that starting from $(a,b)$, the ant returns to the origin before hitting that square. Set up some recursive equations based on the Law of Total Probability to relate all of these. In addition, use the symmetry of our walk to simplify things greatly. The question is asking for $p(0,0)$.",
    "solution": "To solve this, let $p(a,b)$ be the probability that starting from $(a,b)$, the ant returns to the origin before hitting that square. We are going to set up some recursive equations based on the Law of Total Probability to relate all of these. In addition, we use the symmetry of our walk to simplify things greatly. We want $p(0,0)$. Starting from the origin, the ant moves to $(\\pm 1,0)$ or $(0, \\pm 1)$ all with equal probability. However, by the symmetry of our square and our walk, $p(0,1) = p(0,-1) = p(-1,0) = p(1,0)$. By Law of Total Probability, $$p(0,0) = \\dfrac{1}{4}(p(0,1) + p(0,-1) + p(1,0) + p(-1,0)) = p(1,0)$$ Now, we need to find $p(1,0)$. At $(1,0)$, if we move right one unit, we hit the boundary, in which case the probability is $0$. If we move up or down one unit, we hit $(1,1)$ or $(1,-1)$. Again, by the symmetry of the square and our walk, $p(1,1) = p(1,-1)$. Lastly, if we move left one unit, we are back at the origin, so the probability is $1$. Therefore, by Law of Total Probability and our previous relation, $$p(1,0) = \\dfrac{1}{4} \\cdot 0 + \\dfrac{1}{4} \\cdot p(1,-1) + \\dfrac{1}{4} \\cdot p(1,1) + \\dfrac{1}{4} \\cdot 1 = \\dfrac{1}{2} \\cdot p(1,1) + \\dfrac{1}{4}$$ Now, we need to find $p(1,1)$. At $(1,1)$, if we move up or right, then we have hit the square, so our probability is $0$. If we move left or down, we are at $(0,1)$ and $(1,0)$, respectively. By the symmetry of our square and the walk, $p(0,1) = p(1,0)$, so by Law of Total Probability and this relation, $p(1,1) = \\dfrac{1}{2} \\cdot p(1,0)$. By substituting our expression of $p(1,1)$ into the equation for $p(1,0)$, we have that $p(1,0) = \\dfrac{1}{2} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{2} \\cdot p(1,0) + \\dfrac{1}{4}$. Solving for $p(1,0)$, $p(1,0) = \\dfrac{1}{3}$. Since $p(0,0) = p(1,0)$ by our first equation, $p(0,0) = \\dfrac{1}{3}$.",

    "solution": "The key to this question is the following realization: When a toy is produced at all, it is equally likely to be a Bakugan or a Beyblade. The reason is because of the memorylessness property and the fact that they have equal rates of production. By the memorylessness property, the knowledge of when the last Bakugan/Beyblade was produced tells us nothing about when the next one will be produced, so we can just treat it as if we were looking at the probability the first Beyblade comes before the first Bakugan (or vice versa), which is just $\\dfrac{1}{2}$. So now, we can treat this as a sequence of coin flips, where Bakugan is Heads and Beyblades is tails. Reframing this problem, this just asks for the probability the $3$rd heads comes before the second tails. This will always be decided after the $5$th flip. Thus, we really want the number of outcomes where there are at least $3$ Heads in the first $4$ coin tosses. The distribution of the number of heads in the first $4$ coin tosses is $N \\sim \\text{Binom}(4,0.5)$, so we want $\\mathbb{P}[N=3]+ \\mathbb{P}[N=4] = \\dfrac{5}{16}$.",

    "solution": "We are going to start off with a similar trick to Positive Brownian I. We are instead going to compute $\\mathbb{P}[B_2 > 0, B_8 < 0]$. Then, we can receive our result of $\\mathbb{P}[B_2 > 0, B_8 < 0] = \\mathbb{P}[B_2 > 0] - \\mathbb{P}[B_2 > 0, B_8 < 0]$. The first term of this is clearly just $\\dfrac{1}{2}$, as $B_2 \\sim N(0,2)$, which is symmetric about $0$. We are going to solve this question for all $0 \\leq s < t$. Set $X_t=B_t-B_s$ and $Y_s=-B_s$. $X_t \\sim N(0, t-s)$ by the stationarity of Brownian Motion. Furthermore, by independent increments, we know that $X_t$ and $Y_s$ are independent. Letting $I$ be our probability of interest, we have that $$ \\begin{gathered} I=P\\left[B_t&gt0, B_s&lt0\\right]=P\\left[B_t-B_s&gt-B_s,-B_s&gt0\\right]=P\\left[X_t&gtY_s, Y_s&gt0\\right] \\\\ I=\\frac{1}{2 \\pi \\sqrt{s(t-s)}} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\int_y^{\\infty} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{y^2}{2 s}-\\frac{x^2}{2(t-s)}\\right) d x d y \\end{gathered} $$ The integral arises from plugging in the PDFs of $X_t$ and $Y_s$ and then integrating first where $x > y$ and then where $y > 0$. This integral looks difficult to evaluate. We know that normal distributions have radial symmetry in the plane, so attempting to convert to polar coordinates is a good move. To get rid of the denominators in the exponentials, we use the standard $x = r\\cos\\theta$ and $y = r\\sin\\theta$, but with extra terms of $\\sqrt{s}$ and $\\sqrt{t-s}$ to cancel once they are squared. Namely, we have $$ \\begin{gathered} y=r \\sqrt{s}\\sin \\theta \\\\ x= r\\sqrt{t-s} \\cos \\theta \\end{gathered} $$ As we are attempting to switch to a different coordinate system, we need to evaluate the Jacobian of our transformation. Namely, this is $$\\begin{aligned} & d y d x=J d r d \\theta \\\\ & d y d x=\\left|\\begin{array}{ll}\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial r} & \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial \\theta} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial r} & \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial \\theta}\\end{array}\\right| d r d \\theta \\\\ & d y d x=\\left|\\begin{array}{cc}\\sqrt{s} \\cos \\theta & -\\sqrt{s} r \\sin \\theta \\\\ \\sqrt{t-s} \\sin \\theta & \\sqrt{t-s} r \\cos \\theta\\end{array}\\right| d r d \\theta \\\\ & d y d x=\\left(\\sqrt{s(t-s)} r \\cos ^2 \\theta+\\sqrt{s(t-s)} r \\sin ^2 \\theta\\right) d r d \\theta=\\sqrt{s(t-s)} r d r d \\theta\\end{aligned}$$ Next, we need to find our integral bounds. It's fairly clear to see that $0 < r < \\infty$, as there is no bound in our region. As $x > y$ and $y > 0$, this implies $$ \\sqrt{s} r \\sin \\theta<\\sqrt{t-s} r \\cos \\theta $$ By rearranging the above to isolate $\\theta$, we see $$ \\tan \\theta<\\sqrt{\\frac{t-s}{s}} $$ Our bound must be $$ \\theta<\\tan ^{-1}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{t-s}{s}}\\right)=\\cos ^{-1}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{s}{t}}\\right) $$ The second equality just comes from writing out the triangle with side lengths $\\sqrt{t-s}$ opposite, $\\sqrt{s}$ adjacent, and $\\sqrt{t}$ on the hypotenuse. Plugging everything into the integral above, our new integral becomes $$ \\begin{gathered} I=\\frac{1}{2 \\pi} \\int_0^{\\cos ^{-1}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{s}{t}}\\right)} \\int_0^{\\infty} r \\exp \\left(-\\frac{r^2}{2}\\right) d r d \\theta \\\\ I=\\frac{1}{2 \\pi} \\int_0^{\\cos ^{-1}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{s}{t}}\\right)}-\\left.\\exp \\left(-\\frac{r^2}{2}\\right)\\right|_0 ^{\\infty} d \\theta \\\\ I=\\frac{1}{2 \\pi} \\int_0^{\\cos ^{-1}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{s}{t}}\\right)} d \\theta=\\frac{1}{2 \\pi} \\cos ^{-1}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{s}{t}}\\right) \\end{gathered} $$ Plugging in our specific values of $s = 2$ and $t = 8$, our answer is $\\dfrac{1}{2\\pi} \\cos^{-1}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right) = \\dfrac{1}{2\\pi} \\cdot \\dfrac{\\pi}{3} = \\dfrac{1}{6}$.

    "hint": "The yellow die is at least $3$ larger than the green die with probability $\\dfrac{7}{25}$.",
    "solution": "Let $e$ be the expected payout. The yellow die is at least $3$ larger than the green die with probability $\\dfrac{7}{25}$. You can verify this by conditioning on the value of the green die and noting the number of outcomes that are satisfactory if the green die shows $k$ is $8-k$. Summing those up, you get $28$ of $100$ equally-likely outcomes. The dice show the same value with probability $\\dfrac{1}{10}$. Therefore, they show different values with probability $\\dfrac{31}{50}$. Applying the Law of Total Expectation on the outcome of the first roll, $$e = \\dfrac{7}{25}\\cdot (e+1) + \\dfrac{31}{50}e$$ If we roll a value at least $3$ larger on the yellow than the green, then it is as if our game restarts with our money being $1$ instead of $0$. Solving for $e$, we get that $\\dfrac{1}{10}e = \\dfrac{7}{25}$, so $e = \\dfrac{14}{5}$.",

    "hint": "We need three things to happen: The first odd must show up before the first even, the second odd must show up before the first even, and the final odd must show up before the first even. This is really a chain of conditional probabilities, as the second odd showing up must occur given the first odd has already shown up.",
    "solution": "We need three things to happen: The first odd must show up before the first even, the second odd must show up before the first even, and the final odd must show up before the first even. This is really a chain of conditional probabilities, as the second odd showing up must occur given the first odd has already shown up. The probability the first odd shows up before the first even is $\\dfrac{1}{2}$, as the first roll is either odd or even with equal probability, so the first roll must appear odd. Afterwards, given the first odd has appeared, we now have reduced our sample space to $5$ outcomes of interest. If we roll the odd that has already appeared, it is as if we ignore it. Therefore, given one of the other $5$ outcomes occurs, the probability it is odd is $\\dfrac{2}{5}$, as two of the remaining $5$ outcomes are odd integers. By the same logic, once the second odd has occurred, if we see either of those two odds again, we ignore. Conditional on one of the other $4$ outcomes appearing, the probability that it is the final odd is $\\dfrac{1}{4}$, as $1$ of the last $4$ outcomes is odd. This implies that the probability of this event is $\\dfrac{1}{2}\\cdot \\dfrac{2}{5} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{4} = \\dfrac{1}{20}$. Alternatively, consider all $6! = 720$ ways to arrange the orders of the appearance of the $6$ values.

There are $3! \\cdot 3! = 6 \\cdot 6 = 36$ ways to arrange the values satisfying the condition, so the probability of this occurring is $\\dfrac{36}{720} = \\dfrac{1}{20}$.",

    "hint": "Condition on how many faces are showing that are distinct.",
    "solution": "With three dice being rolled originally, we can either have all show the same value, have two distinct values, or have all three be distinct values. We condition on the the number of distinct values showing after the first roll. The probability all of the values are the same is $\\dfrac{6}{6^3} = \\dfrac{1}{36}$, as you can roll the first die and the other two must match that value, which occurs with probability $\\dfrac{1}{6}$ per die. The probability that all three values are distinct is easily calculated to be $\\dfrac{6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4}{6^3} = \\dfrac{5}{9}$. Therefore, the probability that exactly two distinct values appear is $1 - \\dfrac{1}{36} - \\dfrac{5}{9} = \\dfrac{5}{12}$. Now, we must calculate the probability in each case that the second values match the first values. If all values are the same, the probability the second rolling matches the first only happens when all three of the dice share that same value, which occurs with probability $\\dfrac{1}{6^3} = \\dfrac{1}{216}$. If we have two distinct values, say $a \\neq b$, then there are $3$ sequences that would result in the same values as the first rolling, which are $aab, aba,$ and $baa$.

Lastly, if all three values are distinct, say $a \\neq b \\neq c$, there are $3! = 6$ outcomes that result in the same values appearing, so the probability in this case is $\\dfrac{3!}{6^3} = \\dfrac{1}{36}$. By Law of Total Probability, the probability of matching values between the rolls is thus $\\dfrac{1}{36} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{216} + \\dfrac{5}{12} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{72} + \\dfrac{5}{9} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{36} = \\dfrac{83}{3888}$",

    "solution": "We know that the trace of a matrix is the sum of all the eigenvalues repeated according to their algebraic multiplicity. We first need to find the algebraic multiplicity of this non-zero eigenvalue. The trick here is to note that each of the rows of $A_n$ are linearly dependent. Namely, the $k$th row of this matrix is a multiple $k$ times the first row. This means that the subspace $A_nx = 0$ (i.e. the null space of $A_n$) has geometric multiplicity $n-1$, as the other $n-1$ rows are a multiple of the first row. The dimension of the null space, however, is just the geometric multiplicity of $0$ as an eigenvalue. Therefore, $\\text{GM}_{\\lambda = 0}(A_n) = n-1$. We now use another theorem that states that for any $n \\times n$ matrix $A$ and eigenvalue of $A$, say $\\lambda$, $1 \\leq \\text{GM}_{\\lambda}(A) \\leq \\text{AM}_{\\lambda}(A) \\leq n$. As we know $\\text{GM}_{\\lambda = 0}(A_n) = n-1$, we have that $\\text{AM}_{\\lambda = 0}(A_n)$ is either $n-1$ or $n$. However, we can rule out $n$ by the fact that the if the algebraic multiplicity were $n$, the sum of all the eigenvalues (and hence the trace of $A_n$) would be $0$. However, one can quickly see that the trace of $A_n$ is $1^2 + 2^2 + \\dots + n^2 = ||x_n||^2 = \\dfrac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$ by working out the multiplication. Thus, the algebraic multiplicity of $\\lambda = 0$ is $n-1$, and the last eigenvalue must be $$||x_n||^2 = \\dfrac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$$ We can quickly see that the dominating term of $||x_n||^2$ is an $n^3$ term, so $k = 3$ is our answer.",

    "hint": "Break up the hour into two 30-minute interval. If there is no car crash in an hour, there is no car crash in each of the independent 30-minute intervals.",
    "solution": "Let the probability in question be $p$. We know that the probability there is no car crash in the hour interval is $\\dfrac{1}{9}$ by complementation. This is the same as saying that there is no car crash in each of the intervals consisting of the first and last 30 minutes of the hour. By the question, we can say that the number of car crashes in disjoint intervals are independent. This is because they occur at a constant rate throughout time and the arrivals are independent. The probability of no car crash in each of those two intervals individually is $1-p$, so the probability of no car crash in both intervals is $(1-p)^2$. Thus, $(1-p)^2 = \\dfrac{1}{9}$, so $p = \\dfrac{2}{3}$.",

    "task": "Consider the set of integers $S =\\{2,3,\\dots,30\\}$. Alice and Bob play a game where they take turns selecting integers from $S$. The first player to select an integer that shares a common factor with a previously picked integer loses. Alice has the ability to determine if she wants to select first or second.

    "solution": "Consider all the primes in $S: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29$. There are $10$ such integers. The key idea to notice here is that for whoever selects the integer $6$, that eliminates $2$ and $3$. Therefore, no other pairwise products of primes among the remaining prime integers are at most $30$. Therefore, there would be $8$ primes left, and whoever is selecting first in this new game loses, as they can only eliminate one prime factor a turn. However, this \"new game\" is really just the second turn our game after we eliminate $2$ and $3$. Therefore, Alice should go first, select the value $6$ (alternatively, $12, 18,$ or $24$ also work, as they have the same primes in the factorization) so that she can eliminate both $2$ and $3$, and then Bob and Alice alternate selecting among the remaining prime integers. Then, Bob would be forced to pick some non-prime integer, which will have a prime factor among those already eliminated, so Bob will lose. Therefore, Alice should go first, and the answer is $1$. However, there is also another sneaky starting integer, which is $5$. This is because regardless of what Bob selects on his first turn after Alice selects $5$, Alice can force Bob to eliminate one prime factor at a time after her next turn, so this also works. Since $5$ works, $5^2 = 25$ also works. Therefore, $$100(1) + \\dfrac{6 + 12 + 18 + 24 + 5 + 25}{6} = 115$$",

    "task": "Two candidates, say $A$ and $B$, are running for office. Candidate $A$ received $n$ votes, while Candidate $B$ received $m$ votes, with $n > m$. The $n+m$ votes are thrown into a box and shuffled around. Then, the votes are drawn without replacement one-by-one. A running tally of the number of votes for each candidate is kept. The probability that Candidate $A$ is always strictly ahead in the voting count (excluding the initial state where both have $0$) is a function $P(n,m)$. Find $P(100,80)$.",
    "hint": "Use exchangeability and condition on who has the last vote. Then, test some edge cases with $m = 1$.",
    "solution": "Let $P(n,m)$ be the probability of interest with $n$ votes from Candidate $A$ and $m$ votes for Candidate $B$. Since the votes are thrown in the box randomly, the probability any given vote draw is for Candidate $A$ is $\\dfrac{n}{m+n}$, while it is $\\dfrac{m}{m+n}$ for Candidate $B$. Conditioning on which candidate has the last vote, we get that $$P(n,m) = P(n-1,m) \\cdot \\dfrac{n}{m+n} + P(n,m-1) \\cdot \\dfrac{m}{m+n}$$ This is because of the fact that the probability that $A$ is always ahead in all $n$ draws is the same as the probability that $A$ is always ahead if they received $n-1$ votes and $B$ received $m$ votes, which is $P(n-1,m)$. By the same argument, we get that the probability $A$ is always ahead with the last vote being for $B$ is the same as if $A$ is always ahead given $A$ had $n$ votes and $B$ had $m-1$ votes. Our goal is now find $P(n,m)$. A good warm-up is to consider an edge case of when $A$ has $n > 1$ votes and $B$ has $m = 1$ votes. $A$ would always be ahead exactly when the singular $B$ vote is not in the first two draws. If the $B$ vote is in the first two draws, then $B$ would have at least as many votes as $A$ at some point in the first two draws. Otherwise, if the first two draws are for $A$, $B$ can never reach more than $1$ vote. The probability of this is $\\dfrac{n}{n+1} \\cdot \\dfrac{n-1}{n} = \\dfrac{n-1}{n+1}$. This suggests to us to consider $\\dfrac{n-m}{n+m}$ for a general $m$. To prove this, we induct on the value of $n+m$. If $n + m = 1$, this means $n = 1$ and $m = 0$. In this case, $P(1,0) = \\dfrac{1-0}{1+0} = 1$, which is accurate. More generally, suppose this holds for when $n+m = k$ for all $1 \\leq k \\leq r$. We now need to show it holds for $n + m = r+1$. Using our recurrence, $$P(n,m) = \\dfrac{n}{m+n} \\cdot P(n-1,m) + \\dfrac{m}{m+n} \\cdot P(n,m-1) = \\dfrac{n}{m+n} \\cdot \\dfrac{n-1-m}{n-1+m} + \\dfrac{m}{m+n} \\cdot \\dfrac{n-(m-1)}{n+(m-1)} = \\dfrac{n-m}{n+m}$$ We can use our recurrence relation here since if $n+m = r+1$, $n+(m-1) = (n-1)+m = r$, so the induction hypothesis applies. For our particular case, the answer is $\\dfrac{100-80}{100+80} =\\dfrac{1}{9}$",

Even though the two players have the same expected return, Alice is taking on additional risk for her position. Ceteris paribus, Bob's position is favored over Alice's because he achieves higher expected return per unit of positional risk he takes on.",

    "task": "A man went to his local bank to cash a check. When giving his money to the cashier, by mistake, gave him dollars as cents and cents as dollars. He didn't examine the money and just walked home and spent a nickel on some candy. He then found that he possessed exactly twice as much money as the check was worth. He had no money in his pocket before going to the bank. How much was the check for?",
    "hint": "Let $y$ be the number of cents and $x$ be the number of dollars on the check. Then the man's check is $x + 0.01y$. The amount the main was paid is $y + 0.01x$. The amount he had that was exactly twice as much as the check was $y + (0.01x - 0.05)$. Therefore, $2x + 0.02y = y + (0.01x - 0.05)$.",
    "solution": "Let $y$ be the number of cents and $x$ be the number of dollars on the check. Then the man's check is $x + 0.01y$. The amount the main was paid is $y + 0.01x$. The amount he had that was exactly twice as much as the check was $y + (0.01x - 0.05)$. Therefore, $2x + 0.02y = y + (0.01x - 0.05)$. There are two cases to consider here. In the first case, we have that $y < 50$, in which the $0.02y$ term doesn't overflow into another dollar. In this case, we would have that $2x = y$ and $0.02y = 0.01x - 0.05$. If this was true, then $0.04x = 0.01x - 0.05$, which would means that $x < 0$, which is impossible. Therefore, we have that $y \\geq 50$, in which $y = 2x + 1$, as we overflow into another dollar. Additionally, we would have that $0.02y - 1 = 0.01x - 0.05$. Substituting in here, $$0.02(2x+1) - 1 = 0.01x - 0.05 \\iff 0.03x = 0.99 \\iff x = 31$$ Then we have that $y = 2\\cdot 31 + 1 = 63$.

    "hint": "Work the complement of this event. Then break it up into two cases.",
    "solution": "We can use complimentary probability; we'll begin by compute the probability that the third shiny penny appears within the first 4 draws. There are two cases: (1) the third shiny penny appears on the third draw, and (2) the third shiny penny appears on the fourth draw. This is now a very simple ordering problem. There are $\\binom{7}{3} = 35$ total orderings. There is 1 ordering that satisfies case 1, and 3 orderings that satisfy case 2 (there is exactly 1 dull penny that appears in the first 4 draws, and the last of the first 4 draws must be a shiny penny). Our answer is $\\frac{31}{35}$.",

Every outcome where person $B$ has the opportunity to win is the same as person $A$ except scaled by a factor of half since person $B$ must ensure person $A$ misses right before them, so the probability for person $B$ is $\\dfrac{1}{2}p$.

Thus, however Player $1$ moves, you will move the rook to the corresponding square on the diagonal.",

    "hint": "What properties of variance can we use to solve this problem?",
    "solution": "Let $X$ be the number chosen from the first set and $Y$ be the number chosen from the second set. Since $X$ and $Y$ are independent, we know that $$Var(X+Y)=Var(X)+Var(Y) = 2\\cdot Var(X)$$ To find $Var(X)$, we can use the equation $Var(X) = E(X^2)-E(X)^2$. $$E(X^2) = \\dfrac{0^2+1^2+2^2+3^2+4^2}{5}=6$$ $$E(X)^2 = (\\frac{0+1+2+3+4}{5})^2 = 2^2=4$$ Thus $Var(X)=6-4=2$ and $Var(X+Y) = 2\\cdot2 = 4$. Since we are finding the standard deviation, we have to take the square root of the variance. Thus the answer is $2$.",

For example, for the first up-move, when the underlying has value $S_1 = 10$, we either will have $S_2 = 20$ or $S_2 = 5$.

Similarly, we know that $\\text{Var}(X+Y) = \\sigma_X^2 + \\sigma_Y^2 + 2\\sigma_X\\sigma_Y = (\\sigma_X + \\sigma_Y)^2$, so $\\sigma_{X+Y} = \\sigma_X + \\sigma_Y$. By a similar argument, we get $\\text{Var}(X-Y) = \\sigma_X^2 + \\sigma_Y^2 - 2\\sigma_X\\sigma_Y = (\\sigma_X - \\sigma_Y)^2$, so $\\text{Var}(X-Y) = |\\sigma_X - \\sigma_Y|$.

We get the $1$ from the condition that $\\sigma_X > \\sigma_Y$, so the numerator is positive. Another way to see this is that if $X$ and $Y$ are perfectly correlated, then $Y = aX + b$ for some constants $a$ and $b$. Since $\\sigma_X > \\sigma_Y$, it must be the case that $|a| < 1$. Therefore, $X+Y = X(1+a) + b$ and $X-Y = X(1-a) + b$. As $|a| < 1$, both of the constants $1+a$ and $1-a$ are positive. Therefore, as these are both linear transformation of $X$ with the same signs, they must have correlation $1$.",

    "task": "You are holding two identical eggs in a 100-story building. If an egg is dropped at an elevation under story $X$, then the egg will survive; else, the egg breaks. What is the minimum number of drops required to determine $X$ in the worst-case scenario?",
    "hint": "Assume we design a strategy with $N$ maximum drops. If the first egg is dropped once, then the second egg can cover $N-1$ floors. If the first egg is dropped twice, then the second egg can cover $N-2$ floors.",
    "solution": "Suppose that we have a strategy with a maximum number of $N$ drops. For the first drop of the first egg, we can try the $N$-th floor. If the egg breaks, we can start to try the second egg from the first floor and increase the floor number by one until the second egg breaks. At most, there are $N-1$ floors to tests. If the first egg dropped from the $N$-th floor does not break, then we have $N-1$ drops left. This time we can only increase the floor number by $N-1$ for the first egg since the second egg can only cover $N-2$ floors if the first egg breaks. If the egg dropped from the $2N-1$-th floor does not break, then we have $N-2$ drops left. Therefore, we can only increase the floor number by $N-2$ for the first egg since the second egg can only cover $N-3$ floors if the first egg breaks. Using such logic, we can see that the number of floors that these two eggs can cover with a maximum of N drops is $$N+(N-1) + ... 1 \\geq 100 \\newline \\newline \\frac{N(N+1)}{2} \\geq 100 \\newline \\newline N = 14$$",

    "solution": "We first need to find the eigenvalues of $A$. The characteristic polynomial is $p(\\lambda) = \\lambda^2 - \\text{tr}(A) \\lambda + \\text{det}(A)$. It is easy to see that $\\text{tr}(A) = 6$ and $\\text{det}(A) = 5$, so we need to solve $\\lambda^2 - 6\\lambda + 5 = 0$. This easily factors to $(\\lambda - 5)(\\lambda - 1) = 0$, so $\\lambda = 1,5$ are the eigenvalues. Next, we want the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.

Imagine a $6 \\times 6 \\times 6$ cube where each axis records the value of a die such that each of the 216 voxels represents a possible, equally probable outcome. For example the voxel $(3,5,1)$ represents rolling 3 on the first die, 5 on the second die, and 1 on the third die. The set of outcomes where the minimum value is 6 is simply (6,6,6). The set of outcomes where the minimum is exactly 5 is the sub-cube from (5,5,5) to (6,6,6) minus the (6,6,6) voxel; in total, there are $2^3-1^3=7$ possibilities.

Hence, either $p_1 = 2$ or $p_2 = 2$. Now, we use casework. If the primes are 2, 3, 5, then the smallest number $c$ can be between $1$ and $15$. If the primes are 2, 5, 7, then $c$ can be between 1 and 13. If the primes are 2, 11, 13, then $c$ can be between 1 and 7. Finally, if the primes are 2, 17, 19, then the $c = 1$. Hence, there are a total of 36 possible values for $c$. Depending on whether $p_1 = 2$ or $p_2 = 2$, there are two possible ways to assign $a$ and $b$ per each value of $c$. Our final answer is therefore $2 \\cdot 36 = 72$.",

    "solution": "This seems like a very complicated problem on the surface but you can actually use Markov Chains to solve this problem. There is a lot of symmetry in cubes to help us decrease the number of states involved in this question. Letâs let your starting state be $E_{00}$. No matter which way the ant goes, by symmetry itâll basically always be the same position. That position being $1$ side length away from the starting vertex. Lets denote the expected number of moves to get back to the initial vertex as $E_{1}$. Thus $E_{00} = E_{1}+1$. Let $E_{2}$ be the expected number of moves from being in the state of $2$ side lengths away from the starting vertex. Finally, let $E_{3}$ be the expected moves from being at the opposite vertex of the starting vertex. The equations for all these states are: $$ E_{00} = E_{1}+1 E_{1} = \\frac{2}{3}E_{2}+\\frac{1}{3}E_{0}+1 E_{2} = \\frac{2}{3}E_{1}+\\frac{1}{3}E_{3}+1 E_{3} = E_{2}+1 $$ We know that $E_{0}=0$.

Then we have that $$T = \\dfrac{\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^{2n}X_i}{k}$$ gives the total number of $k-$cycles, as we need to remove rotations ($k$ such rotations per $k-$cycle).

Now that we have selected the elements, there are $(k-1)!$ ways to arrange those elements. Then, there are $(2n-k)!$ ways to arrange the other $2n-k$ elements. This yields that our probability that $1$ belongs to a cycle is $$\\dfrac{\\binom{2n-1}{k-1}(k-1)!(2n-k)!}{(2n)!} = \\dfrac{1}{2n}$$ Therefore, $\\mathbb{E}[T] = \\dfrac{1}{k}$ after substituting in. The above tells us that the expected number of $k-$cycles for $1 \\leq k \\leq 2n$ is $\\dfrac{1}{k}$. Therefore, $\\mathbb{E}[C_n]$ is just the sum of the terms above from $n+1$ to $2n$.

    "solution": "For the variance to be a maximum, we need to optimize in two ways. Namely, we have to maximize the spread from the mean as well as the randomness about that mean. To maximize the distance of all points away from the mean, we should have a discrete random variable. This is because a continuous random variable has density throughout an interval, which makes it more compact about the mean. We can't have just one value in our discrete random variable, as then the variance would be $0$. Therefore, with $2$ values, we should aim to separate them from the mean the furthest. This can be done by taking the values $-1$ and $1$, as those are the endpoints of our allowed interval. Then, to maximize how \"random\" our distribution is, we should set $p = \\dfrac{1}{2}$. This would maximize something called the entropy. Note that with $p = \\dfrac{1}{2}$, the mean is $0$.

    "hint": "Use Law of Total Probability to condition on the next value.",
    "solution": "Let $f(x)$ be the expected largest number given that the current largest is $x$. We want $f(0)$, as we are selecting uniform values on $(0,1)$, so our initial largest value is $0$. We don't choose a starting value lower than $0$ since we can't generate values lower than $0$. With probability $x$, the next value is smaller than $x$, and our largest value will be $x$. Otherwise, if our next value is $y&gtx$, $y$ is uniformly distributed on $(x,1)$, so the expected maximum in that case is $f(y)$. We integrate over all $x < y < 1$ since we are applying Law of Total Probability. Written as an equation, this is $$f(x) = x^2 + \\displaystyle \\int_x^1 f(y)dy$$ Taking the derivative to convert into a differential equation, we get that $f'(x) = 2x - f(x)$. Equivalently, $f'(x) + f(x) = 2x$. An initial condition for this differential equation is $f(1) = 1$, as we can't go any higher than $1$. This is a linear first order differential equation, so we can use the method of integrating factors here. In particular, the integrating factor is $\\mu(x) = e^{\\int 1 dx} = e^{x}$. Multiplying this on both sides, $(e^{x}f(x))' = 2xe^{x}$, meaning $e^{x}f(x) = \\displaystyle \\int 2xe^{x}dx = 2e^x(x-1) + C$. This means that $f(x) = 2x - 2+ Ce^{-x}$. Using our initial condition $f(1) = 1$, this yields $C = e$, so $f(x) = 2(x-1) + e^{1-x}$. In particular, $f(0) = e-2$, so our answer is $1 - 2 =-1$. For a sanity check, we can note that the answer to this question and the answer to Decreasing Uniform Chain sum to $1$. This makes perfect sense. If $X_i \\sim \\text{Unif}(0,1)$, then $1 - X_i \\sim \\text{Unif}(0,1)$, so there is a symmetry between the two problems.",

    "hint": "Take a \"dynamic programming\" approach in the sense that you compute the expected payout based on what happened before.",
    "solution": "Let $X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_6$ denote the amount of money won on turn $1, 2, \\ldots, 6$, respectively. By linearity of expectation, the total amount of money won is simply $\\mathbb{E}[X_1] + \\mathbb{E}[X_2] + \\ldots + \\mathbb{E}[X_6]$. Clearly, $\\mathbb{E}[X_1] = \\frac{1}{2}$, so let's begin our discussion with the second turn. After Jamie makes a guess from round 1, regardless of the guess and the true card, Jamie will have information for the correct 3 card-2 card split of the remaining 5 cards. Under the optimal strategy, Jamie should guess the value of the card that appears 3 times in the remaining 5 cards. Hence, $\\mathbb{E}[X_2] = \\frac{3}{5}$. The expected value of round 3 depends on the previous two guesses; specifically, there is either a 3-1 split or a 2-2 split. Once again, Jamie should know the true split and guess accordingly. It is not difficult to conclude that the probability of a 3-1 split is $\\frac{2}{5}$, since there are $20$ total orderings of 3 aces and 3 jacks, and $\\frac{4}{1} \\cdot 2$ of those orderings begin with ace-ace or jack=jack. That means that there is a $\\frac{3}{5}$ chance that there is a 2-2 split. By the law of total expectation, we have $\\mathbb{E}[X_3] = \\frac{3}{5} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{2}{5} \\cdot \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{3}{5}$. The expected value of round 4 can be computed similarly. There is either a 2-1 split or a 3-0 split. The 3-0 split occurs with probability $\\frac{1}{10}$, while the 2-1 split occurs with probability $\\frac{9}{10}$. By linearity of expectation, we find $\\mathbb{E}[X_4] = \\frac{1}{10} \\cdot 1 + \\frac{9}{10} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{7}{10}$. The expected value of round 5 can be conditioned on a 2-0 split which occurs with probability $\\frac{2}{5}$ or a 1-1 split which occurs with probability $\\frac{3}{5}$. By linearity of expectation, we find $\\mathbb{E}[X_5] = \\frac{2}{5} \\cdot 1 + \\frac{3}{5} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{2} = \\frac{7}{10}$. By round 6, there is only one card remaining, so $\\mathbb{E}[X_6] = 1$. Putting it all together, our expected value is $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{3}{5} + \\frac{3}{5} + \\frac{7}{10} + \\frac{7}{10} + 1 = \\frac{5+6+6+7+7+10}{10} = \\frac{41}{10}$.",

From the last sum, we see that $k = 2$ yields an exponent of $7$, so the coefficient there is $\\dfrac{3}{2!} = \\dfrac{3}{2}$, so that sum adds a total of $\\dfrac{3}{2} \\cdot 7!$. Adding these two terms up, we get a sum of $8400$, which we can conclude to be $f^{(7)}(0)$.",

    "task": "An oil tanker is tasked with the goal of transporting $3000$ gallons of oil from Port A to Port B which are $1000$ miles apart. However, the oil tanker loses $1$ gallon of oil for every mile it travels from spillage (at a constant rate) and can carry a max of $1000$ gallons at any time. The tanker can also dump any oil that it is carrying at any number of storage ports on the way from Port A to Port B and pick it up later. Assuming an optimal travel plan where you decide where to place any number of storage ports and how to carry the oil, how many gallons can you transport form Port A to Port B (round to the nearest gallon)?",
    "hint": "Where should be put our storage ports to maximize our fuel efficiency?",
    "solution": "The key realization in this question is how to place the storage ports to maximize the amount of oil you are carrying per oil lost. This realization leads to the idea of having multiples of $1000$ gallons at any storage port. If you don't, you aren't maximizing the efficiency metric above. Where do we place the first storage port to hold $2000$ gallons of oil? Well, we need to leave $\\frac{2000}{3}$ gallons every time we arrive there from Port A. This means that the distance should be $1000-\\frac{2000}{3} = \\frac{1000}{3}$ miles away from Port A. If we only have this storage port, we will bring $1000-\\frac{2000}{3} = \\frac{1000}{3}$ gallons twice to Port B $=\\frac{2000}{3}\\approx 667$ gallons. But we can do better by having another storage port that is a multiple of $1000$ gallons, that being the port that will have $1000$ gallons. From the first storage port, we can go $500$ miles and drop off $500$ gallons to the second storage port twice. This means this second storage port should be located $500$ miles away from the first storage port $=500+\\frac{1000}{3} = \\frac{2500}{3}$ miles away from Port A. Now we have $1000$ gallons of oil that is $1000-\\frac{2500}{3} = \\frac{500}{3}$ miles away from Port B. We can carry these $1000$ gallons all at once and lose $\\frac{500}{3}$ gallons of oil which leaves us with $1000-\\frac{500}{3}=\\frac{2500}{3}\\approx 833$ gallons of oil at Port B.",

    "task": "Three points are randomly selected uniformly at random on the circumference of a circular slab. Then, 3 table legs are attached vertically at those three points. For this table to be \"proper\", no two legs can be within 90 degrees of one another. What is the probability that this table is \"proper\"?",
    "hint": "Fix the first leg arbitrarily. How much of the table is banned from having more legs in it? The valid placement region for the third leg depends on the second leg location. Condition on the location of the second leg and use symmetry of the region and the fact our distribution is uniform.",
    "solution": "Attach the first leg of the table at an arbitrary position. Since the density is uniform, we do not need to worry about anything. Now, we know that the other legs can't be within 90 degrees of the first leg. Therefore, we can imagine shading out a region spanning 90 degrees in each direction emanating from the first leg location. This shades out half of the table. From this point on, it may be helpful to get a piece of paper and draw all of this out to convince yourself of the arguments below. Now, we need to ensure that the remaining two legs are not within 90 degrees of one another. However, this probability is dependent upon the location of the second leg. This is because wherever we place the second leg, there is going to be some overlap potentially in the region that is shaded out because of it. How much overlap there is depends on how far away the first leg is from the second. We know that the valid range to put the second leg is $90$ to $270$ degrees (all orientations are assumed to be CCW) away from the first. By the symmetry of our region and our uniform distribution of the points, as the region that is available to place the third point in is equal in length (and hence probability) if we put the second at $180 + x$ versus $180 - x$, we can just consider the region $90$ to $180$ degrees away from the first point and double it to get the total probability. If we place our second leg at $90 + x$ degrees, $0 < x < 90$, then there are $90-x$ degrees remaining at which we can place the third leg. Therefore, by using continuous version of Law of Total Probability the probability we are interested in is $\\displaystyle \\int_0^{90} 2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{360} \\cdot \\dfrac{90-x}{360}dx$. Recall that the $2$ is because we double to account for the other region of $180$ to $270$ degrees away CCW. Therefore, $\\dfrac{2}{360^2} \\displaystyle \\int_0^{90} 90 - xdx = \\dfrac{1}{16}$, which is our solution.",

    "task": "There are 2 white and 3 black balls in an urn. Rajiv randomly draws balls out of the urn without replacement; he has the option to stop drawing at any time. For every white ball he draws, he earns $\\$1$, but for every black ball he draws, he loses $\\$1$. Suppose Rajiv draws balls following the optimal strategy. What is his expected loss or gain?",
    "hint": "Compute the expected payout based on when he receives his first white ball",
    "solution": "There is a $\\frac{2}{5}$ chance that Rajiv draws the first white ball on the first draw. There is a $\\frac{3}{5} \\cdot \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{3}{10}$ chance that Rajiv draws the first white ball on the second draw. There is a $\\frac{3}{5} \\cdot \\frac{2}{4} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{5}$ chance that Rajiv draws the first white ball on the third draw. And finally, there is a $\\frac{3}{5} \\cdot \\frac{2}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{10}$ chance that Rajiv draws the first white ball on the fourth draw. If Rajiv draws a white ball on the first draw, then if he were to keep going until the last white ball is drawn, the expected value of his gain/loss would be $\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 1 \\text{ (HTTT) } + \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 0 \\text{ (THTT) } + \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot -1 \\text{ (TTHT) } - \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot -2 \\text{ (TTTH) } = -\\frac{1}{2}$. We conclude that if Rajiv draws his first white ball on the first draw, the he should stop immediately and receive the payoff of $+\\$1$. If Rajiv draws a white ball on the second draw, then if he were to keep going until the last white ball is drawn, the expected value of his gain/loss would be $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 1 \\text{ (HTT) } + \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 0 \\text{ (THT) } + \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot -1 \\text{ (TTH) } = 0$. So, if Rajiv draws his first white ball on the second draw, his payoff will be $0 + 0 = +\\$0$ regardless of whether he keeps drawing until the last head is drawn. If Rajiv draws a white ball on the third draw, then if he were to keep going until the last white ball is drawn, the expected value of his gain/loss would be $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1 \\text{ (HT) } + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 0 \\text{ (TH) } = 0$. So, if Rajiv draws his first white ball on the third draw, he should keep drawing until he gets the second white ball, with total payoff $-1 + \\frac{1}{2} = -\\$\\frac{1}{2}$ And of course, if Rajiv gets 3 blacks in a row for his first 3 draw, he should finish drawing the last two white balls, which gives him a payoff of $-3 + 2 = -\\$1$. In total, his expected profit is $\\frac{2}{5} - \\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{1}{5}$. Note that, while the above solution is more methodical, one could simply write out all $\\frac{5!}{2!3!} = 10$ permutations of 2 white and 3 black balls. It would then be much faster to visualize potential strategies.",

If $p = 1/2$, find the expected number of steps until the particle reaches $1$. If the answer is infinite, answer $-1$.",

    "solution": "We generalize this for $p \\geq 1/2$. Let $T_1$ be the number of steps needed to move from position $0$ to $1$. We want $\\mathbb{E}[T_1]$. We use Law of Total Expectation to condition on what happens at the first step. If the particle moves right at the first step, which occurs with probability $p$, then $T_1 = 1$, as the particle has hit $1$. Otherwise, with probability $1-p$, the particle moves left. The expected number of steps in this would be $1 + 2\\mathbb{E}[T_1]$, as the number of steps needed to move from $-1$ to $0$ and $0$ to $1$ are the same by the Markov Property. This means that $$\\mathbb{E}[T_1] = p \\cdot 1 + (1-p) \\cdot (1 + 2\\mathbb{E}[T_1])$$ Rearranging and solving yields $\\mathbb{E}[T_1] = \\dfrac{1}{2p-1}$. With $p = 1/2$, this yields $\\infty$.

    "solution": "Among the 98 remaining penalty kicks, you must score exactly 65, which occurs ${98 \\choose 65}$ ways. Let us now find the probability of each one of these outcomes occurring. The denominator of the probability must be $99!$, which is the product of the total number of kicks at each time step ($\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{x}{3} \\times \\frac{y}{4} \\times ... = \\frac{z}{99!}$). Similarly, the numerator must be $65! \\times 33!$, since there must be exactly 65 successful kicks and exactly 33 failed kicks. Thus, the probability of any such arrangement of is $\\frac{65! 33!}{99!}$, and the probability that you score exactly 66 penalty kicks is: $${98 \\choose 65} \\times \\frac{65! \\times 33!}{99!} = \\frac{1}{99}$$",

Applying the same logic now to the remaining four points, we get that the probability these pairs do not intersect is $\\frac{2}{3}$. In the other $\\frac{1}{5}$ chance that the first point is paired with the point directly across, we need the remaining four points not to intersect the chord. The only way for this to happen is if the pairs on each side of the chord are paired with each other. This has probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.

Let $N$ be the number of times Steve must select a door before reaching safety and $T$ be the total amount of time it takes for Steve to get out.

    "hint": "Write $T$ as a sum with random upper index and apply Wald's Identity. Break up $T \\mid N = n$ into two parts.",
    "solution": "We have that $T = \\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^N X_i$, where $X_i$ is the time spent on the $i$th selection of tunnel. This is because Steve has to do $N$ trials to escape, since $N$ is the number of trials needed before he gets out. We just have to take the average of the three times spent going down the three paths to get $\\mathbb{E}[X_i]$, as they are equally likely. Thus, $$\\mathbb{E}[X_i] = \\dfrac{2+4+8}{3} = \\dfrac{14}{3}$$ This directly implies that $B_n = \\dfrac{14}{3}n$ by linearity of expectation. To find $A_n$, if we have that $N = n$, that means on the first $n-1$ runs of the tunnel, we have that Steve took either path 1 or 2 instead of 3, and then on the $n$th run, he chooses path 3. We thus have that $$\\mathbb{E}[T \\mid N = n] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}X_i + X_n \\hspace{3pt} \\Big| \\hspace{3pt} X_i \\neq 8, 1 \\leq i \\leq n-1, X_n = 8\\right]$$ These conditional expectations are equivalent because we have that $X_i = 8$ corresponds to selecting path 3. Thus, simplifying the conditional expectation, we have that this is equivalent to $\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\\mathbb{E}[X_i \\mid X_i \\neq 8] + 8$ by linearity. The expectation in the sum is just the conditional expectation of $X_i$ given that it is either $2$ or $4$. Since these occur with equal probability, the conditional expectation inside the expectation is just $3$. Since we sum it $n-1$ times, we have that $A_n = \\mathbb{E}[T \\mid N = n] = 3n+5$. This means that $\\dfrac{A_n}{B_n} = \\dfrac{9n+15}{14n}$. The limit of this function is just $\\dfrac{9}{14}$, as it is the coefficients of $n$ divided.",

    "hint": "Three points are selected uniformly at random on the perimeter of the unit circle and are labelled points $A,B,$ and $C$. Find the expected perimeter of the triangle $ABC$. The answer is in the form $\\dfrac{a}{\\pi}$ for a rational number $a$. Find $a$.",
    "solution": "The triangle is formed by drawing chords between each pair of points. As the points are IID, the three side lengths are exchangeable. This means that the expected perimeter is just obtained by tripling the expected length of one of the sides of the triangle. In other words, if $P$ is the perimeter and $S_{AB}$ is the length of the chord between points $A$ and $B$, $\\mathbb{E}[P] = 3\\mathbb{E}[S_{AB}]$. This question now boils down to finding the expected length of a chord drawn in a circle. Let $\\theta$ and $\\phi$ be IID $\\text{Unif}(0,2\\pi)$. Picking the two angles is equivalent to picking the two points uniform on the circumference. The measure of the angle between $\\theta$ and $\\phi$ is $\\theta - \\phi$. To get the length of the line segment connecting the two points, we can take a slight shortcut. The length here only depends on the distance between our points we select in terms of angle. In other words, regardless of where we end up having our points located, we can just rotate the circle so that one of them is located at $(1,0)$. Therefore, we can arbitrarily fix $\\theta_1 = 0$. Thus, the length between $\\theta_1 = 0$ and the point at $\\theta_2 = \\theta$ is $\\sqrt{(1 - \\cos(\\theta))^2 + \\sin^2(\\theta)} = \\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{1 - \\cos(\\theta)}$. This means that finding the expected length of the chord is equivalent to finding $\\sqrt{2}\\mathbb{E}[\\sqrt{1 - \\cos(\\theta)}]$, where $\\theta \\sim \\text{Unif}(0,2\\pi)$. Now, $\\sqrt{2}\\mathbb{E}[\\sqrt{1 - \\cos\\theta}] = \\dfrac{\\sqrt{2}}{2\\pi}\\displaystyle \\int_0^{2\\pi}\\sqrt{1-\\cos\\theta}d\\theta$. Now, the best approach is to conjugate the interior by multiplying and dividing by $\\sqrt{1+\\cos\\theta}$ so that we get $\\sqrt{1-\\cos^2\\theta} = |\\sin\\theta|$. Doing this, we get $\\dfrac{\\sqrt{2}}{2\\pi}\\displaystyle \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\dfrac{|\\sin\\theta|}{\\sqrt{1+\\cos\\theta}}d\\theta$. Note that the region on $(0,\\pi)$ and $(\\pi,2\\pi)$, our integrand is symmetric, so we can just evaluate over one interval and double it. This means our new integral is $\\dfrac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\pi} \\displaystyle \\int_0^{\\pi} \\dfrac{\\sin\\theta}{\\sqrt{1+\\cos\\theta}}d\\theta$. Let $u = 1 + \\cos\\theta$.

Assume the amount of time it takes for the horseman to get from the back to the front is $t_1$ and then the time it takes for him to get to the back from the front is $t_2$. The distance travelled by the rider is $s(t_1 + t_2)$. The distance travelled by the army is $t_1 + t_2$, so $t_1 + t_2 = 50$. Therefore, we just need to find $s$. Relative to the crowd, the horseman moves at a speed of $s-1$ in the first leg and a speed of $s+1$ in the second leg when returning. Therefore, $t_1(s-1) = t_2(s+1) = 50$, as the horseman had to go from the back to the front in both cases relative to the line. This means that $t_1 = \\dfrac{50}{s-1}$ and $t_2 = \\dfrac{50}{s+1}$, so $50 = \\dfrac{50}{s-1} + \\dfrac{50}{s+1}$.

We do this again (split the $6$ potential beans into $3$ groups of $2$) and find the group of $2$ in which the abnormal bean is a part of. Then we can simply weigh one bean on either side to find the heavier one. Thus it takes a total of $3$ weighings.

To set our notation, let $e_i$ represent the additional number of flips needed to stop our process once we have $i$ heads. If $X = 4$, then obviously we don't flip any coins again, so $\\mathbb{E}[T \\mid X = 4] = 4$. This would mean $e_4 = 0$. Similarly, if $X = 3$, then we aren't able to flip just one tails, so $\\mathbb{E}[T \\mid X = 3] = 4$. This would mean $e_3 = 0$. If $X = 2$, then we are going to continually flip the two tail coins again until we don't obtain $TT$. We have that $\\mathbb{E}[T \\mid X = 2] = 4 + e_2$, as it takes $4$ flips at the beginning and then need $e_2$ additional flips to stop. We have that $$e_2 = \\dfrac{1}{4} \\cdot (2 + e_4) + \\dfrac{1}{2} \\cdot (2 + e_3) + \\dfrac{1}{4} \\cdot (2 + e_2)$$ This stems from the fact that we flip $2$ coins, and we get $0,1,$ or $2$ heads with those prescribed probabilities fries those two coins. Solving for $e_2$ here by plugging in $e_3 = e_4 = 0$ is $e_2 = \\dfrac{8}{3}$, so $\\mathbb{E}[T \\mid X = 2] = 4 + \\dfrac{8}{3} = \\dfrac{20}{3}$. Iterating this logic, if $X = 1$, then we flip two tails until they don't appear $TT$. We know that $\\mathbb{E}[T \\mid X = 1] = 4 + e_1$ by the same logic as above. By doing the same conditioning argument, we have that $$e_1 = \\dfrac{1}{4} \\cdot (2 + e_3) + \\dfrac{1}{2} \\cdot (2 + e_2) + \\dfrac{1}{4} \\cdot (2 + e_1)$$ Plugging in $e_3 = 0$ and $e_2 = \\dfrac{8}{3}$ yields that $e_1 = \\dfrac{40}{9}$. Therefore, $\\mathbb{E}[T \\mid X = 1] = \\dfrac{40}{9} + 4 = \\dfrac{76}{9}$. Lastly, if $X = 0$, we have that $\\mathbb{E}[T \\mid X = 0] = 4 + e_0$. By doing the same conditioning argument once again, we get that $$e_0 = \\dfrac{1}{4} \\cdot (2 + e_2) + \\dfrac{1}{2} \\cdot (2 + e_1) + \\dfrac{1}{4} \\cdot (2 + e_0)$$ Solving for $e_0$ by plugging in $e_2 = \\dfrac{8}{3}$ and $e_1 = \\dfrac{40}{9}$ yields $e_0 = \\dfrac{176}{27}$.

    "task": "A player rolls a standard fair $6-$sided die. If the player rolls a $6$, the game ends and the player receives no payout. Otherwise, the player may quit and receive $\\$k$, where $k$ is the upface of the previous roll. Otherwise, the player may roll again under the same rules. Assuming optimal play from the player, what is their expected payout?",
    "hint": "Given that the player does not roll a $6$, what is the conditional expectation of their die roll? When should the person roll again?",
    "solution": "Intuitively, given that the player does not roll a $6$, the conditional expectation of their die roll is $3$. The sum of the rest of the faces of the die is $15$, which are distributed over $5$ faces. Therefore, the player should keep any value at least $3$ and re-roll any value below $3$. Let $e_3$ be the expected payout of this strategy. We have that $$e_3 = \\dfrac{1}{3}\\cdot e_3 + \\dfrac{1}{2} \\cdot 4$$ This is since with probability $1/3$, the person rolls $1$ or $2$, in which the game essentially restarts. With probability $1/2$, the person rolls $3,4,$ or $5$, which has conditional expectation $4$. Solving for this, we get that $e_3 = 3$, which is our optimal strategy. One can also show that if you re-roll anything below $4$, you get the same expected payout. This makes intuitive sense because of the fact that at $3$, you are indifferent to keeping or rolling again.",

    "solution": "Let $x$ be the amount of money that the friend allocates and $n$ be the number of people in the present week that needed money. Then $\\dfrac{x}{n}$ was the payout for each of them. We can translate what the man said into math. The first statement says that $$\\dfrac{x}{n-5} = \\dfrac{x}{n} + 2$$ This is because there are $n-5$ people that need money compared to the previous week. The second statement says that $$\\dfrac{x}{n+4} = \\dfrac{x}{n} - 1$$ Therefore, the goal is to solve these two equations simultaneously. In the first equation, multiplying by $n(n-5)$ on both sides yields $nx = x(n-5) + 2n(n-5)$, which simplifies to $5x = 2n(n-5) = 2n^2 - 10n$. Multiplying by $n(n+4)$ on both sides in the second equation, $nx = x(n+4) - n(n+4)$, which simplifies to $4x = n(n+4) = n^2 + 4n$. Subtracting twice of the second equation from the first equation yields that $-3x = -18n$, which means that $\\dfrac{x}{n} = 6$.",

    "hint": "$\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\displaystyle \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\mathbb{P}[X \\geq k]$. What does the event $\\{X \\geq k\\}$ mean here for an appropriately selected random variable $X$?",
    "solution": "We solve this using the classic trick $\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\displaystyle \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\mathbb{P}[X \\geq k]$ for non-negative integer-valued random variables $X$. Let $X$ be the number of distinct faces showing up. We now need to find $\\displaystyle \\mathbb{P}[X \\geq k]$ for $k = 1,2,\\dots,6$. We know for $k \\geq 7$ this is $0$ since there are only $6$ sides on the die.$\\mathbb{P}[X \\geq 1] = 1$, as you have to roll at least one distinct side to be able to repeat it. Now, for $\\mathbb{P}[X \\geq 2]$, we need to roll any value besides our first face before the first face again. This is determined within one roll, and the probability of this is $\\dfrac{5}{6}$, as there are $5$ values that haven't been selected yet. For $\\mathbb{P}[X \\geq 3]$, we need to obtain 2 distinct faces, which occurs with probability $\\dfrac{5}{6}$, and then we need to roll another distinct face on the next turn, which occurs with probability $\\dfrac{2}{3}$.

    "task": "Aaron flips a fair coin until he receives an equal amount of heads and tails. For example, HHTHTT would correspond to $6$ flips. What is the reciprocal of the expected number of flips Aaron does?",
    "hint": "Consider the absolute difference between the number of heads and tails.",
    "solution": "Our first flip will either turn up to be $H$ or $T$. Therefore, the difference (in absolute value) between the number of $H$ and $T$ will be $1$ after $1$ flip. Let $H_n$ and $T_n$, respectively, be the number of heads and tails that occur in the first $n$ flips. If $N$ represents our stopping time, then $N = \\text{min}\\{n > 0 : H_n = T_n\\}$. The key here is that we consider $S_n = |H_n - T_n|$, the absolute difference between the number of heads and tails in the first $n$ flips. We can see that $S_n$ is a symmetric random walk on the non-negative integers with a reflecting boundary at $0$. This is because we either move left or right $1$ with equal probability at each step when $S_n > 0$. These correspond to either the difference between heads and tails increasing or decreasing by $1$ at each step. Furthermore, the fact that this is a reflecting random walk is irrelevant to this question. This is because we want to stop at the first time where we return to $S_n = 0$, when $H_n = T_n$ and don't care what happens after that. Therefore, our question simplifies to finding the expected return time to $0$ in a symmetric random walk on the integers starting from $1$. Mathematically, we want $\\mathbb{E}[N]$, where $N = \\text{min}\\{n > 0 : S_n = 0\\}$ and we start at $S_0 = 0$. There are some further simplifications that can be made. Since the random walk is shift-invariant, this is the expected time starting from $0$ to hit $-1$ in our random walk. Since our random walk is symmetric, the expected time to hit $-1$ is the same as the expected time to hit $1$. If $R_n$ is a symmetric random walk on the integers (recall that we no longer care that it is on the positive integers), then we want $\\mathbb{E}[N_1]$, with $N_1 = \\text{min}\\{n : R_n = 1\\}$. Suppose that $\\mathbb{E}[N_1] < \\infty$. As we can represent $R_n = \\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$, with each $X_i$ being $\\pm 1$ with equal probability IID (this is the sum of left and right steps), by Wald's Identity, $\\mathbb{E}[R_{N_1}] = \\mathbb{E}[N_1]\\mathbb{E}[X_1]$. We know that the LHS is $1$ with probability $1$ by the definition of $N_1$. By a direct calculation, we know $\\mathbb{E}[X_1] = 0$. Therefore, if $\\mathbb{E}[N_1]$ were finite, the LHS would be $1$ and the RHS $0$, leading to a contradiction. Thus, this expectation must be infinite and the answer is 0.",

The three resultant pieces are then of lengths $5,X,$ and $8 - X$. We can use the condition for triangles be valid i.e. the sum of any 2 sides is longer than the remaining side to determine the valid values of $X$ that make this a triangle. The three inequalities say that $5 < X + (8 - X) = 8$, which is useless. Then, $X < 5 + (8 - X)$, so $X < \\dfrac{13}{2}$ is our first condition. In addition $8-X < 5 + X$, so that $X > \\dfrac{3}{2}$ is our second condition.

This is because we can only improve our stance by rolling a number larger, but the sum is guaranteed to go over $7$ in any of these cases if our first roll is any of these numbers.

    "task": "Ramanujan is running late to teach his lecture. He must run a mile across Cambridge to the lecture hall within ten minutes in order to get to his students on time. Beginning with attempt $n = 1$, he runs a distance of $x_n$ miles in $t_n$ minutes towards the lecture hall and repeats the process if he has (1) not yet arrived at the hall and (2) still has time to spare; the maximum value of $n$ is 3. The values of $x_n$ are chosen independently and uniformly at random between $0$ and $1$ miles, while the values of $t_n$ are chosen independently and uniformly at random between $0$ and $10$ minutes. If Ramanujan runs out of time during his $j$-th attempt, then time magically stops, allowing him to finish traveling the remainder of the $x_j$ miles. If Ramanujan runs equal to or more than a mile total within the ten minutes, then he arrives at the hall on time. What is the probability that Ramanujan gets to the lecture hall on time?",
    "hint": "How can geometric probability be useful here? Consider graph shading as a possible approach to this problem.",
    "solution": "First, to simplify things, let's consider 10 minutes as 1 complete unit of time. We have: \\[\\begin{aligned} X_1, X_2, X_3 &\\overset{\\text{iid}}{\\sim} \\text{Unif}([0, 1]), \\text{and} \\\\ T_1, T_2, T_3 &\\overset{\\text{iid}}{\\sim} \\text{Unif}([0, 1]). \\end{aligned}\\] Note that Ramanujan may either take two attempts or three attempts to reach the lecture hall. As long as Ramanujan has some time left over (for example, if $T_1 < 1$), then he will have the opportunity to run another time (that isâin our exampleâRamanujan will add $X_2$ to his total distance traveled regardless of the value of $T_2$). We wish to find the probability that Ramanujan makes it to class on time, which can be expressed as \\[\\begin{aligned} \\mathbb{P}(X_1 + X_2 > 1, T_1 < 1) + \\mathbb{P}(X_1 + X_2 < 1, X_1 + X_2 + X_3 > 1, T_1 + T_2 < 1). \\end{aligned}\\] Note that the events $X_1 + X_2 > 1, T_1 < 1$ and $X_1 + X_2 < 1, X_1 + X_2 + X_3 > 1, T_1 + T_2 < 1$ are in fact mutually exclusive, which justifies the application of countable additivity. Now, let's simplify, making use of the fact that events only involving $T_n$ are independent from events only involving $X_n$. \\[\\begin{aligned} &\\quad \\; \\mathbb{P}(\\text{Ramanujan on time}) \\\\ &= \\mathbb{P}(X_1 + X_2 > 1, T_1 < 1) + \\mathbb{P}(X_1 + X_2 < 1, X_1 + X_2 + X_3 > 1, T_1 + T_2 < 1) \\\\ &= \\mathbb{P}(X_1 + X_2 > 1) \\mathbb{P}(T_1 < 1) + \\mathbb{P}(X_1 + X_2 < 1, X_1 + X_2 + X_3 > 1) \\mathbb{P}(T_1 + T_2 < 1) \\\\ &= \\mathbb{P}(X_1 + X_2 > 1) + \\mathbb{P}(X_1 + X_2 < 1, X_1 + X_2 + X_3 > 1) \\mathbb{P}(T_1 + T_2 < 1) \\\\ \\end{aligned}\\] Notice that $\\mathbb{P}(T_1 + T_2 < 1) = \\mathbb{P}(T_1 + T_2 > 1) = \\mathbb{P}(X_1 + X_2 < 1) = \\mathbb{P}(X_1 + X_2 > 1)$. We quickly find $\\mathbb{P}(T_1 + T_2 < 1) = \\frac{1}{2}$ by plotting the inequality on the $T_1$-$T_2$ plane. More specifically, one may compute this probability with \\[\\begin{aligned} \\mathbb{P}(T_1 + T_2 < 1) &= \\int_{0}^1 \\int_{0}^{1 - t_2} \\; f_{T_1, T_2}(t_1, t_2) \\; dt_1 \\, dt_2, \\text{ where } \\\\ f_{T_1, T_2}(t_1, t_2) &= f_{T_1}(t_1) f_{T_2}(t_2) = 1 \\quad \\text{ due to independence } \\end{aligned}\\] Substituting, we have \\[\\begin{aligned} \\mathbb{P}(\\text{Ramanujan on time}) &= \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\mathbb{P}(X_1 + X_2 + X_3 > 1, X_1 + X_2 < 1). \\end{aligned}\\] It is much easier to compute $\\mathbb{P}(X_1 + X_2 + X_3 > 1, X_1 + X_2 < 1)$ by plotting the region satisfying the inequality $X_1 + X_2 + X_3 > 1$ on the $X_1$-$X_2$-$X_3$ plane, where the volume of interest is strictly above the region $ X_1 + X_2 < 1$ on the $X_1$-$X_2$ plane. However, one may choose to compute this probability as follows: \\[\\begin{aligned} &\\quad\\; \\mathbb{P}(X_1 + X_2 + X_3 > 1, X_1 + X_2 < 1)\\\\ &= \\int_{0}^1 \\int_{0}^{1 - x_2} \\int_{1-x_1-x_2}^1 f_{X_1, X_2, X_3}(x_1, x_2, x_3) \\, dx_3 \\, dx_1 \\, dx_2, \\text{where} \\\\ f_{X_1, X_2, X_3}(x_1, x_2, x_3) &= f_{X_1}(x_1) f_{X_2}(x_2) f_{X_3}(x_3) = 1 \\quad \\text{ due to independence } \\end{aligned}\\] The value of the above integral is $\\frac{1}{3}$. So, \\[\\begin{aligned} \\mathbb{P}(\\text{Ramanujan on time}) &= \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{6} \\\\ &= \\frac{2}{3} \\end{aligned}\\]",

If $X_1 \\leq x$, then we have a remaining sum of $x - X_1$ remaining to exceed. Therefore, our expectation $1+m(x-X_1)$ in this case. We need to integrate over all values of $X_1$ from $0$ to $x$ by Law of Total Expectation. The expression that results is $$m(x) = (1-x) \\cdot 1 + \\displaystyle \\int_0^x (1 + m(x-y))dy = 1 + \\int_0^x m(x-y)dy$$ We can make the $u-$substitution $u = x - y$ and obtain the new integral equation $m(x) = 1 + \\displaystyle \\int_0^x m(u)du$. Assuming differentiability of $m(x)$, take the derivative on both sides and apply the fundamental theorem of calculus to obtain $m'(x) = m(x)$. The classic solution to this equation is $m(x) = Ce^x$. We now need an initial condition to obtain a particular solution. A reasonable initial condition is that $m(0) = 1$, as with probability $1$, our first random variable is larger than $0$, so it takes exactly $1$ random variable to exceed $0$. This initial condition implies $C = 1$ and $m(x) = e^x$. Note that this equation is only valid for $0 < x < 1$. This is because for $0 < x < 1$, we can exceed $x$ with one random variable. Otherwise, for $x > 1$, the RHS is $m(x) - m(x-1)$. It is a good exercise to verify this. As $\\ln(2) < 1$, the above is irrelevant for this question, so $m(\\ln(2)) = e^{\\ln(2)} = 2$.",

We want to find $\\mathbb{P}[W_2 \\mid W_1]$. Let the event $U_i$ be when urn $i$ is selected. Since we select the urn uniformly random, $\\mathbb{P}[U_i] = \\dfrac{1}{n}$, for all $1 \\leq i \\leq n$. Suppose we select urn $1 \\leq k \\leq n$. There is 1 white ball and $2^k - 1$ black balls in it. There is independence between draws, as the ball selected is replaced after the first draw. Thus, on either draw, since we select the ball completely at random, $\\mathbb{P}[W_1 \\mid U_k] = \\mathbb{P}[W_2 \\mid U_k] = \\dfrac{1}{2^k}$, and $\\mathbb{P}[W_1^c \\mid U_k] = \\mathbb{P}[W_2^c \\mid U_k] = \\dfrac{2^k-1}{2^k}$. We have the conditioning on $U_k$, as we assumed that we are in urn $k$. Thus, the probability of two white balls, given we are in urn $k$, by independence is just $\\mathbb{P}[W_1W_2 \\mid U_k] = \\mathbb{P}[W_1 \\mid U_k]\\mathbb{P}[W_2 \\mid U_k] = \\dfrac{1}{4^k}$. The second draw from the urn is either a white ball or a black ball, so the other case to consider is if we are in urn $k$, what is the probability the second ball is black? By independence: \\[\\begin{aligned} \\mathbb{P}[W_1W_2^c \\mid U_k] = \\mathbb{P}[W_1 \\mid U_k]\\mathbb{P}[W_2 \\mid U_k] = \\dfrac{2^k - 1}{4^k} = \\dfrac{1}{2^k} - \\dfrac{1}{4^k}. \\end{aligned}\\] We want $\\mathbb{P}[W_2 \\mid W_1] = \\dfrac{\\mathbb{P}[W_1W_2]}{\\mathbb{P}[W_1]}$ by conditional probability.

We are going to apply the Law of Total Probability to our denominator by conditioning on the urns again to get: \\[\\begin{aligned} \\mathbb{P}[W_1W_2^c] = \\mathbb{P}[W_1W_2^c \\mid U_1]\\mathbb{P}[U_1] + \\mathbb{P}[W_1W_2^c \\mid U_2]\\mathbb{P}[U_2] + \\dots + \\mathbb{P}[W_1W_2^c \\mid U_n]\\mathbb{P}[U_n] \\end{aligned}\\] The $\\mathbb{P}[U_i]$ term is the same as in the numerator, and we also have that: \\[\\begin{aligned} \\mathbb{P}[W_1W_2^c \\mid U_i] = \\dfrac{2^i - 1}{4^i} = \\dfrac{1}{2^i} - \\dfrac{1}{4^i}, \\forall 1 \\leq i \\leq n \\end{aligned}\\] Thus, we have: \\[\\begin{aligned} \\mathbb{P}[W_1W_2^c] &= \\dfrac{2 - 1}{4} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{n} + \\dfrac{2^2 - 1}{4^n} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{n} + \\dots + \\dfrac{2^n - 1}{4^n} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{n} \\\\ &= \\dfrac{1}{n}\\displaystyle \\sum_{j=1}^n \\dfrac{2^j - 1}{4^j} \\end{aligned}\\] And therefore: \\[\\begin{aligned} \\mathbb{P}[W_2 \\mid W_1] &= \\dfrac{\\dfrac{1}{n}\\displaystyle \\sum_{j=1}^n \\left(\\dfrac{1}{4}\\right)^j}{\\dfrac{1}{n}\\displaystyle \\sum_{j=1}^n \\left(\\dfrac{1}{4}\\right)^j + \\dfrac{1}{n}\\displaystyle \\sum_{j=1}^n \\dfrac{2^j - 1}{4^j}} \\\\ &= \\dfrac{\\displaystyle \\sum_{j=1}^n \\left(\\dfrac{1}{4}\\right)^j}{\\displaystyle \\sum_{j=1}^n \\left(\\dfrac{1}{4}\\right)^j + \\displaystyle{\\sum_{j=1}^n\\left(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)^j - \\left(\\dfrac{1}{4}\\right)^j\\right)}} \\\\ &= \\dfrac{\\displaystyle \\sum_{j=1}^n \\left(\\dfrac{1}{4}\\right)^j}{\\displaystyle \\sum_{j=1}^n \\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)^j} \\end{aligned}\\] All that is left is to take the limit as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$.

We get $71$ powers of $2$ from all the even terms. Then, there are $\\text{floor}\\left(\\dfrac{142}{2^2}\\right) = 35$ additional powers of $2$ coming from terms divisible by $4$. We keep doing this to obtain that there are $$\\displaystyle \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\text{floor}\\left(\\frac{n}{2^k}\\right)$$ trailing zeroes in binary for $n!$. Note that this sum is finite since eventually $2^k > n$, so the floor will become $0$.

    "solution": "We know that $\\sqrt{k^k} = k^{\\frac{k}{2}}$ by basic algebra. Therefore, if $k$ is even, $\\dfrac{k}{2}$ is an integer, so if $k$ is even, this works. This allows $151$ integers.

Therefore, odd perfect squares are not accounted for yet, so we can add those in. Namely, these are $11^2, 13^2, 15^2, 17^2,$ and $19^2$.

Find the expected length of the sequence at the end of the game. For example if the sequence of rolls is $34265241$, we would reset to an empty sequence at the first roll, reset to an empty sequence at the $5$, and our final sequence would be $241$, which is of length $3$.",

This above solution is incorrect because it more implicitly assumes that we just \"ignore\" $3$s and $5$s that appear. Therefore, this is not the correct assumption we want to make.

As the die is memoryless (i.e. is not affected by what has already appeared), given that the first $1$ appears before both the first $3$ and first $5$, what is the expected number of rolls needed to obtain the $1$? Let's let $N$ represent the number of rolls needed to see a $1$, and let $B$ be the event that $1$ occurs before both $3$ and $5$. By symmetry, $\\mathbb{P}[B] = 1/3$, as each is equally likely to appear first. We now condition on the value of the first roll. Let $R_i$ represent the event that we roll value $i$ on the first roll. This would imply by Law of Total Expectation that $$\\mathbb{E}[N \\mid B] = \\sum_{i=1}^6 \\mathbb{E}[N \\mid R_i,B]\\mathbb{P}[R_i \\mid B]$$ For $i = 2,4,6$, we have that $\\mathbb{P}[R_i \\mid B] = \\dfrac{P[B \\mid R_i]\\mathbb{P}[R_i]}{\\mathbb{P}[B]}$. Since the event that we roll $i = 2,4,6$ on the first roll doesn't affect the probability of appearance of $1$ before $3$ and $5$, we have that $\\mathbb{P}[B \\mid R_i] = \\mathbb{P}[B]$. Clearly $\\mathbb{P}[R_i] = 1/6$ based on the fact the die is fair, so $\\mathbb{P}[R_i \\mid B] = 1/6$ for $i = 2,4,6$. We have that $\\mathbb{P}[R_3 \\mid B] = \\mathbb{P}[R_5 \\mid B] = 0$, as there is no chance that our first roll can be $3$ or $5$ if $1$ comes before them. Thus, since the conditional probability measure is a probability measure, we have that $\\mathbb{P}[R_1 \\mid B] = 1 - 3 \\cdot 1/6 = 1/2$. If we roll a $1$ on the first roll, then our sequence is complete and of length $1$, so $\\mathbb{E}[N \\mid B,R_1] = 1$. Otherwise, if $i = 2,4,6$, then $\\mathbb{E}[N \\mid B,R_i] = 1 + \\mathbb{E}[N \\mid B]$, as we used up one roll and need to continue forward. Therefore, the equation we need to solve is $$\\mathbb{E}[N \\mid B] = \\dfrac{1}{2}\\left(1 + \\mathbb{E}[N \\mid B]\\right) + \\dfrac{1}{2}$$ This is easily solved to yield $\\mathbb{E}[N \\mid B] = 2$. You can instead view this problem as saying that whenever we roll a $1,3,$ or $5$, we make it a $1$ so that the $1$ occurs before the $3$ and $5$. Therefore, the probability of rolling an odd integer on each trial is $1/2$, meaning that $N \\mid B \\sim \\text{Geom}(1/2)$, which has mean $2$. This agrees with the answer above.",

This is a reasonable assumption because of the fact in each collision, both ants will move in the direction of the other ant after the collision. Therefore, it is as if no collision happened at all. This means that $80$ ants reach Alice and $40$ ants reach Bob. Therefore, $80 - 40 = 40$ is our answer.",

    "hint": "Break up the event based on when Jenny stops rolling. What needs to occur for her to stop rolling after exactly $n$ rolls? Think about the negative binomial distribution.",
    "solution": "We are going to break up the event based on when Jenny stops rolling. We know that she needs to roll at least $4$ times, as she needs to observe both $2$ $5$s, as well as a $4$ and a $6$. Suppose that Jenny stops after $n$ rolls. In the first $n-1$ rolls, she must have obtained exactly $2$ $5$s. There are $\\displaystyle \\binom{n-1}{2}$ ways to pick the locations of those two fives. Then, the last roll must either be a $4$ or a $6$, and that value must not appear in the rolls beforehand. There are $2$ options for the last roll. WLOG, let it be $6$. In the other $n-3$ rolls that come beforehand, they are able to be any value $1-4$, but there must be at least one $4$ in the sequence so that we have both $4$ and $6$ occur. There are $4^{n-3}$ sequences total for the other $n-3$ rolls, of which we need to exclude the ones with no $4$s in them, which is $3^{n-3}$ sequences. Therefore, there are $4^{n-3} -3^{n-3}$ sequences for the other rolls. Lastly, there are $6^n$ total sequences of length $n$. Therefore, the probability she stops after $n \\geq 4$ rolls is $$\\dfrac{\\displaystyle 2 \\cdot \\binom{n-1}{2}\\cdot (4^{n-3} - 3^{n-3})}{6^n}$$ To find the total probability, we just sum up over $n$ now. This is the sum $$\\displaystyle \\sum_{n=4}^{\\infty} \\dfrac{\\displaystyle 2 \\cdot \\binom{n-1}{2}\\cdot (4^{n-3} - 3^{n-3})}{6^n} = 2\\left[\\sum_{n=4}^{\\infty} \\binom{n-1}{3-1} \\dfrac{1}{6^3} \\cdot \\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^{n-3} - \\sum_{n=4}^{\\infty} \\binom{n-1}{3-1} \\dfrac{1}{6^3} \\cdot \\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)^{n-3}\\right]$$ The terms in the parenthesis look similar to Negative Binomial distributions with $r = 3$ and $p = 1/3$ and $1/2$, respectively However, they are slightly off, we need the constant terms $\\dfrac{1}{6^3}$ to be $\\dfrac{1}{3^3}$ and $\\dfrac{1}{2^3}$, respectively. Therefore, we just need to multiply by $2^3$ and $3^3$ in each sum. However, the support of a Negative Binomial starts at $r = 3$, and these start at $r = 4$. To remedy this, it is easy to take the complement to evaluate each sum with the complement and evaluating the PMF at $3$ for each. Doing all of this, $$2\\left[\\dfrac{1}{2^3}\\sum_{n=4}^{\\infty} \\binom{n-1}{3-1} \\dfrac{1}{3^3} \\cdot \\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^{n-3} - \\dfrac{1}{27} \\cdot \\sum_{n=4}^{\\infty} \\binom{n-1}{3-1} \\dfrac{1}{2^3} \\cdot \\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)^{n-3}\\right] = \\dfrac{1}{4} \\cdot \\dfrac{26}{27} - \\dfrac{2}{27} \\cdot \\dfrac{7}{8} = \\dfrac{19}{108}$$",

Then, the remaining 3 balls need to be partitioned amongst the 5 bowls; there are a total of $\\binom{3 + 5 - 1}{5 - 1} = 35$ ways to do this. Our answer is $$330 - 5 \\cdot 35 = 155$$",

Therefore, the sum in the second term is $2^n \\cdot \\dfrac{t}{2^n} = t$. For the first sum, we expand out the square and pair up all the terms.

The auction shop says that each person that bids will place a bid that is uniformly distributed between $\\$500$ and $\\$1000$. They also state that they can recruit people to bid for a price of $\\$10$ per person. However, the auction shop also states that Carter will only receive the payment of the second highest bid. Assuming Carter selects the optimal number of people to bid on his gold, what is his expected payout?",
    "hint": "Write the expected payout as a function of $n$, the number of people that they recruit. Try to maximize it with respect to $n$.",
    "solution": "It is known that given $X_1,\\dots, X_n \\sim \\text{Unif}(0,1)$ IID and $S_{i,n}$ is the $i$th smallest, $1 \\leq i \\leq n$, among $X_1,\\dots, X_n$, $\\mathbb{E}[S_{i,n}] = \\dfrac{i}{n+1}$. This also extends now to Unif$(500,1000)$, as this is just a scaling and shifting of a Unif$(0,1)$. Namely, if $X \\sim \\text{Unif}(0,1)$, $500X + 500 \\sim \\text{Unif}(500,1000)$. Therefore, if $S_{i,n}'$ is the $i$th smallest among $n$ IID Unif$(500,1000)$ random variables and $S_{i,n}$ is as above, $\\mathbb{E}[S_{i,n}'] = 500\\mathbb{E}[S_{i,n}] + 500 = 500 + \\dfrac{500i}{n+1}$.

The cost of obtaining $n$ people is $10n$. Therefore, our profit, which we can denote as $P_n$, is $P_n = S_{i,n}' - 10n$, so $\\mathbb{E}[P_n] = \\mathbb{E}[S_{i,n}'] - 10n = 1000\\left(1 - \\dfrac{1}{n+1}\\right) - 10n$. We want to find $n$ that maximizes this. Calling this function $f(n)$, we can treat $n$ as continuous and find the value of $n$ that maximizes it by taking the derivative and setting it equal to $0$. This means $f'(n) = \\dfrac{1000}{(n+1)^2} - 10 = 0$. Rearranging yields $(n+1)^2 = 100$, so as $n$ must be positive, $n = 9$ bidders gives us the maximal expected profit.

Whoever draws the last remaining ball in the urn loses. Alice can choose whether to go first or second. Let $p$ be the position of Alice ($p = 1$ if she should go first, $p = 2$ if she should go second). Let $b$ be the maximum number of balls Alice should select on her first turn if Bob chooses $32$ balls on his first turn. Find $100p + b$.",
    "hint": "If Alice can leave $3m+1$ balls in the urn for an integer $m$ for Bob to select from, she will have a winning strategy.",
    "solution": "If Alice can leave $3m+1$ balls in the urn for an integer $m$ for Bob to select from, she will have a winning strategy. As $100 = 3(33) + 1$, she should let Bob go first. This means $p = 2$. Once Bob selects, Alice can always leave $3x+1$ balls for some integer $x$ for Bob to select from. This is because if Bob selects $2^k = (3-1)^k = 3n + (-1)^k$ balls for an integer $n$, given that there are already $3m+1$ balls in the urn for Bob to select from, then there would now be $$3(m - n) + 1 - (-1)^k = 3m' + 1 + (-1)^{k+1}$$ remaining balls for an integer $m'$. Thus, you should pick $2^y$ balls, where $y \\equiv k+1 \\hspace{3pt} \\text{mod} \\hspace{3pt} 2$ This would cancel out the $(-1)^{k+1}$ term at back. All of the above implies that the strategy for Alice is to let Bob go first. If Bob selects $2^k$, then Alice should select $2^{k+1}$, if possible. If that isn't possible based on how many balls remain, Alice should select a smaller exponent equal in parity to $2^{k+1}$ i.e. $2^{k-1}, 2^{k-3}, \\dots$ that is possible to select. In our scenario here, since Bob selects $32$ on his first turn, there are $68$ left, so Alice should select $64$ balls, as that is still possible.

Of those dogs, $\\dfrac{3}{4}$ are followed by another dog, etc. Therefore, we can write $$d = \\dfrac{6}{7}c + \\dfrac{6}{7} \\cdot \\dfrac{3}{4}c + \\dfrac{6}{7} \\cdot \\left(\\dfrac{3}{4}\\right)^2 c + \\dots = \\dfrac{6c}{7} \\displaystyle \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\left(\\dfrac{3}{4}\\right)^k = \\dfrac{24c}{7}$$ Substituting this into our initial equation, $\\dfrac{31c}{7} = 1$, so $c = \\dfrac{7}{31}$.

The equivalent formulation of the problem above is to count the number of proper parenthesizations of $19$ $($ and and $19$ $)$. This is equivalent because of the fact that a proper parenthesization can't have more closing parentheses than opening parentheses at any point throughout. For example, in the $2$ opening and closing case, $(())$ and $()()$ are valid, but $)(()$ and $())($ are not valid. This problem is well-known to be solved by the Catalan numbers. In particular, the number of proper parenthesizations with $n$ opening and closing parentheses is $C_n = \\dfrac{1}{n+1}\\binom{2n}{n}$. In the above, we are only identifying people by their bill number. This means that there are $\\displaystyle \\binom{2n}{n}$ distinct arrangements of people in the line with $n$ of each type.

Next, let's consider some basic cases to build intuition. If $p_1$ is on the corners of the edge then the probability the remaining point is a distance of &gt1 away is $\\frac{1}{2}$.

    "task": "Let $X_1,X_2,X_3,X_4 \\sim \\text{Exp}(1)$ IID represent the lifetimes of $4$ lightbulbs before burning out. Find the expected time until the last lightbulb burns out.",
    "hint": "If $X_1,X_2,\\dots,X_n \\sim \\text{Exp}(\\lambda)$ IID, then $\\text{min}\\{X_1,\\dots, X_n\\} \\sim \\text{Exp}(n\\lambda)$.",
    "solution": "We use the fact that if $X_1,X_2,\\dots,X_n \\sim \\text{Exp}(\\lambda)$ IID, then $\\text{min}\\{X_1,\\dots, X_n\\} \\sim \\text{Exp}(n\\lambda)$. This is a good exercise to prove if you have not done so before. The time until the $4$th lightbulb burns out is equal to the sum of the times between lightbulb burnouts. Namely, let $T_1$ be the time until the first lightbulb burns out, $T_2$ be the time until the second lightbulb burns out after the first, $T_3$ be the time until the third lightbulb burns out after the second, and $T_4$ be the additional time until the last lightbulb burns out after. Then $S = T_1 + T_2 + T_3 + T_4$ represents the total time it takes until no lightbulbs are left. $T_1 = \\text{min}\\{X_1,X_2,X_3,X_4\\}$, as it is the time for the first lightbulb to die. Therefore, $T_1 \\sim \\text{Exp}(4)$ by our fact before and $\\mathbb{E}[T_1] = \\dfrac{1}{4}$. As the exponential distribution is memoryless, at the time the first dies, the remaining life of the other lightbulbs are still each $\\text{Exp}(1)$ distributed. Without loss of generality, say lightbulb $4$ was the one that burned out. If $R_1,R_2,R_3 \\sim \\text{Exp}(1)$ IID represent the time after the first lightbulb burnt out until the next, Therefore, $T_2 = \\text{min}\\{R_1,R_2,R_3\\}$, meaning $T_2 \\sim \\text{Exp}(3)$ by our fact before, meaning $\\mathbb{E}[T_2] = \\dfrac{1}{3}$. Continuing this same logic on two lightbulbs and the final lightbulb yields $\\mathbb{E}[T_3] =\\dfrac{1}{2}$ and $\\mathbb{E}[T_4] = 1$. By linearity of expectation, we get that $$\\mathbb{E}[S] = 1 + \\dfrac{1}{2} + \\dfrac{1}{3} + \\dfrac{1}{4} = \\dfrac{25}{12}$$",

We want the conditional probability of moving to position $i+1$ in the next step given that the particle is currently at position $i$ and eventually reaches position $n$. Given that we are currently at position $i$, the particle needs to move $n-i$ more steps to reach position $n$. Since $p < 1/2$, we can use the formula from Particle Reach III to yield the probability of reaching $n$ from $i$ is $\\dfrac{p^{n-i}}{(1-p)^{n-i}}$. This is the denominator of the conditional probability. On the numerator, we are currently at position $i$. Then, we move to position $i+1$ with probability $p$ in the next step. Afterwards, the particle needs to move $n-(i+1)$ more steps to reach position $n$, which occurs with probability $\\dfrac{p^{n-(i+1)}}{(1-p)^{n-(i+1)}}$. Therefore, the numerator of our conditional probability is $p \\cdot \\dfrac{p^{n-(i+1)}}{(1-p)^{n-(i+1)}} = \\dfrac{p^{n-i}}{(1-p)^{n-(i+1)}}$ The answer is thus $$\\dfrac{p^{n-i}/(1-p)^{n-(i+1)}}{p^{n-i}/(1-p)^{n-i}} = 1-p$$ In particular, $p = 1/3$ here, so the answer is $2/3$.",

Let $g_n$ be the number of arrangements that satisfy our condition. Derive a recurrence relation for $g_n$ based on conditioning with one of the gloves labelled $n$.",
    "solution": "We are going to solve the more general case with $n$ pairs of gloves labelled $1-n$. Note that there are $\\displaystyle \\dfrac{(2n)!}{2^n \\cdot n!}$ ways to pair up the $2n$ gloves, as there are $(2n)!$ total arrangements, $n!$ ways to re-label the pairs, and then $2$ ways to switch around the order in each pair. Let $g_n$ be the number of arrangements that satisfy our condition. Consider the two gloves labelled $n$, say $n_1$ and $n_2$. Decide the partner for $n_1$ first. We either have that $n_2$ is paired with $n_1$, in which case, we go back to the same problem but with $n-1$ pairs of gloves instead of $n$. Otherwise, $n_1$ is paired with one of the gloves labelled $n-1$, of which there are $2$ ways to pick that glove. Afterwards, we know that $n_2$ is paired with the other glove labelled $n-1$, and that becomes fixed. Then, this goes back to the same problem but with $n-2$ pairs of gloves instead. Therefore, we get the recurrence relation $$g_n = g_{n-1} + 2g_{n-2}$$ Remember that the $2$ in front of $g_{n-2}$ represents the fact that we have $2$ options of the glove labelled $n-1$ to match with $n_1$ in that sub-case. We now need some initial conditions. Note that $g_1 = 1$, as there is clearly only one pair. Furthermore, we have $g_2 = 3$, as we can pick the partner for any one of the gloves in $3$ ways, and that fixes the other pair immediately. The characteristic equation of this recurrence relation is $r^2 - r - 2 = 0$, of which the solutions are $r = 2, -1$. Therefore, $g_n = c_0 \\cdot 2^n + c_1 \\cdot (-1)^n$. Plugging in the initial conditions yields that $1 = 2c_0 - c_1$ and $3 = 4c_0 + c_1$. Solving these yields that $c_0 = \\dfrac{2}{3}$ and $c_1 = \\dfrac{1}{3}$. Therefore, $$g_n = \\dfrac{2^{n+1} + (-1)^n}{3}$$ Therefore, the probability of this event occurring with $n$ pairs is given by $$p_n = \\dfrac{g_n}{\\frac{(2n)!}{2^n \\cdot n!}} = \\dfrac{(2^{n+1} + (-1)^n) \\cdot 2^n \\cdot n!}{3(2n)!}$$ Substituting in $n = 5$, we get that $p_5 = \\dfrac{1}{45}$.",

    "solution": "The optimal strategy is going to be the same for both players due to the symmetry of the game. We also immediately know that $s \\geq 3$ because for $s = 1,2,3$, regardless of what is rolled by each player, you will receive your payout. Therefore, there is no benefit to select $s = 1$ or $2$. What we need here is a Nash Equilibrium. In other words, neither player can improve their expected earnings by increasing the value on their die. Therefore, suppose the equilibrium is $(3,3)$. If this was the case, then if your opponent changes their die to $4$ sides, they shouldn't be any better off. Clearly the expected value for both players with $3-$sided dice each is $2$, as they receive payment regardless. However, if your opponent changes to a $4-$sided die, they now have an expected payout of $2.5$, as they will still get the money regardless of what is rolled. Therefore, $s \\geq 4$ now. Now, we need to compute the same for $(4,4)$ and $(4,5)$. If both players select $4$, the expected payout for each player is $$1 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{4} + 2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{4} + 3 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{4} + 4 \\cdot \\dfrac{3}{16} = \\dfrac{9}{4}$$ This is because the outcome where both roll a $4$ is now worth $0$, so when you roll a $4$, there are only $3$ possible outcomes of the other player where you get that money. In the case $(4,5)$, the expected payout for the player rolling a $5$ is $$1 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{5} + 2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{5} + 3 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{5} + 4 \\cdot \\dfrac{3}{20} + 5 \\cdot \\dfrac{2}{20} = \\dfrac{23}{10} > \\dfrac{9}{4}$$ Therefore, if you select $4$ sides, the other player would select more than $4$ sides and have a higher expected payout. Therefore, $s = 5$ or $6$ now. We now need to compute this for $(5,5)$ and $(5,6)$. If both players select $5$, the expected payout for each is $$1 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{5} + 2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{5} + 3 \\cdot \\dfrac{4}{25} + 4 \\cdot \\dfrac{3}{25} + 5 \\cdot \\dfrac{2}{25} = \\dfrac{49}{25}$$ If you select $5$ and the other player selects $6$, then your opponent's expected payout is $$1 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{6} + 2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{6} + 3 \\cdot \\dfrac{4}{30} + 4 \\cdot \\dfrac{3}{30} + 5 \\cdot \\dfrac{2}{30} + 6 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{30} = \\dfrac{11}{6} < \\dfrac{49}{25}$$ This means that the other player is not better off by increasing the number of sides on their die.

Compute the probability after $10$ steps, Tort and Bort are back at their initial positions and that Tort was strictly behind Bort at all $10$ steps. The answer will be in the form $$\\dfrac{\\displaystyle \\binom{a}{b}^p - \\binom{c}{d}^p}{2^r}$$ where $b \\leq \\dfrac{a}{2}$ and $d \\leq \\dfrac{c}{2}$.

    "hint": "If $X_n$ is the position of Tort and $Y_n$ is the position of Bort (both at time $n$), imagine plotting $(X_n,Y_n)$ in the plane. Think about complementation and some type of reflection principle.",
    "solution": "If $X_n$ is the position of Tort and $Y_n$ is the position of Bort (both at time $n$), imagine plotting $(X_n,Y_n)$ in the plane. Essentially, we would want the number of paths staying strictly below the $X_n = Y_n$ line. Let $N^*_{10,(a,b) \\rightarrow (c,d)}$ be the number of paths where Tort is below Bort the entire time starting at $(a,b)$ and ending at $(c,d)$ after $10$ steps. Let $N_{10,(a,b) \\rightarrow (c,d)}$ be the number of paths from $(a,b)$ to $(c,d)$ in $10$ steps. Lastly, let $N^c_{10,(a,b) \\rightarrow (c,d)}$ be the number of paths where Tort does catch up to Bort at some point in the $10$ steps that start at $(a,b)$ and end at $(c,d)$. The question here is asking for $\\dfrac{N^*_{10,(0,4) \\rightarrow (0,4)}}{2^{20}}$, as each path is equally likely and there are $2^{20}$ total paths that can be taken ($2^{10}$ for each of the turtles). A quick observation is that $N^*_{10,(0,4) \\rightarrow (0,4)} = N_{10,(0,4) \\rightarrow (0,4)} - N^c_{10,(0,4) \\rightarrow (0,4)}$. This is really just the complementary rule. Computing $N_{10,(0,4) \\rightarrow (0,4)}$ is not particularly difficult, and we will do so closer to the end. However, there is no clear way to compute $N^c_{10,(0,4) \\rightarrow (0,4)}$ right now, so we should focus on that first. If some path is part of $N_{10,(0,4) \\rightarrow (0,4)}$, that means that Tort must have caught up to Bort at some point. In other words, the $X_n = Y_n$ line was crossed at some point. Therefore, the idea is to reflect the path up until that meeting point across the $X_n = Y_n$ line and then keep the rest of the path untouched. In particular, the point $(0,4)$ gets reflected to $(4,0)$. Therefore, there is a one-to-one correspondence between paths that cross the $X_n = Y_n$ line that are counted for $N^c_{10,(0,4) \\rightarrow (0,4)}$ and unconstrained paths (since once we do the reflection, there are no issues with crossing) from $(4,0)$ to $(0,4)$. This implies that $$N^c_{10,(0,4) \\rightarrow (0,4)} = N_{10,(4,0) \\rightarrow (0,4)}$$ Substituting this into our first expression, we get that $$N^*_{10,(0,4) \\rightarrow (0,4)} = N_{10,(0,4) \\rightarrow (0,4)} - N_{10,(4,0) \\rightarrow (0,4)}$$ All that is left is to calculate $N_{10,(a,b) \\rightarrow (c,d)}$. For this, we just need to multiply together the number of paths from $a$ to $c$ in $10$ steps (this corresponds to Tort) and number of paths from $b$ to $d$ in $10$ steps (this corresponds to Bort). To get from $a$ to $c$ in $10$ steps, if we move right $x$ times, we must move left $10-x$ times. Therefore, our position would be $a + x -(10-x)$. We need this to equal $c$, so we must solve for $x$ in $a+x-(10-x) =c$, which yields $x = \\dfrac{10+c-a}{2}$. This implies that $N_{10,(a,b) \\rightarrow (c,d)} = \\displaystyle \\binom{10}{x_1}\\binom{10}{x_2}$, where $x_1 = \\dfrac{10+c-a}{2}$ and $x_2 = \\dfrac{10+d-b}{2}$. Therefore, $N_{10,(0,4) \\rightarrow (0,4)} = \\displaystyle \\binom{10}{5}^2$ and $N_{10, (4,0) \\rightarrow (0,4)} = \\displaystyle \\binom{10}{3}^2$. This implies our final probability is $$\\dfrac{\\displaystyle \\binom{10}{5}^2 - \\binom{10}{3}^2}{2^{20}}$$ Extracting the values, $a = c = 10$, $b = 5$, $d = 3$, $p = 2$, and $r = 20$. This means $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + p^2 + r^2 = 638$.",

However, you also have the option to re-flip all 4 coins for $\\$1$. If you re-flip whenever you get $0$ or $1$ heads on the initial flip, what is the fair value of this game?",
    "solution": "We know that if we get $2$ or more heads then we keep our result. Otherwise, we flip all of them again for $\\$1$. The probability we re-flip is just the probability we obtain $0$ or $1$ heads from our first flipping process. As the number of heads in the four flips is $X_1 \\sim \\text{Binom}\\left(4,\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)$ distributed, we are looking for $\\mathbb{P}[X_1 = 0] + \\mathbb{P}[X_1 = 1]$ as our probability to flip again. Plugging in, this comes out to $\\dfrac{5}{16}$. The expected number of heads obtained is $2$ as $\\mathbb{E}[X_1] = 4 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{2} = 2$. Therefore, if $G$ is the expected payout of our game, by Law of Total Expectation $$\\mathbb{E}[G] = \\mathbb{E}[G \\mid X_1 \\leq 1]\\mathbb{P}[X_1 \\leq 1] + \\mathbb{E}[G \\mid X_1 > 1]\\mathbb{P}[X_1 > 1]$$ As we know that $\\mathbb{P}[X_1 \\leq 1] = \\dfrac{5}{16}$, $\\mathbb{P}[X_1 > 1] = 1 - \\dfrac{5}{16} = \\dfrac{11}{16}$. Now, we need to find the expected payout in each case. If $X_1 \\leq 1$, we re-flip, in which case the expected number of heads on the second flip is $2$. However, note that we pay $\\$1$ to flip again, so $\\mathbb{E}[G \\mid X_1 \\leq 1] = 2 - 1 = 1$. If $X_1 > 1$, then we know that $X_1 = 2,3,$ or $4$. In this case, we are not flipping again, so we just keep the payout equal to the number of heads obtained. To find this, we need to find the conditional distribution of $X_1 \\mid X_1 > 1$. Namely, by Bayes' Rule, we have that $$\\mathbb{P}[X_1 = 2 \\mid X_1 > 1] = \\dfrac{\\mathbb{P}[X_1 = 2, X_1 > 1]}{\\mathbb{P}[X_1 > 1]} = \\dfrac{6}{11}$$ Similarly, we can show $\\mathbb{P}[X_1 = 3 \\mid X_1 > 1] = \\dfrac{4}{11}$ and $\\mathbb{P}[X_1 = 4 \\mid X_1 > 1] = \\dfrac{1}{11}$. Therefore, $\\mathbb{E}[G \\mid X_1 > 1] = 2 \\cdot \\dfrac{6}{11} + 3 \\cdot \\dfrac{4}{11} + 4 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{11} = \\dfrac{28}{11}$. With all of these values, we substitute back in and find $\\mathbb{E}[G] = \\dfrac{5}{16} \\cdot 1 + \\dfrac{28}{11} \\cdot \\dfrac{11}{16} = \\dfrac{33}{16}$.",

More generally, for $1 < x < 2$, by replacing $2$ with $x$, note, that the bounds of the integral would now become $x-1$ to $x$ in this case, so $$f(x) = 1 + \\displaystyle \\int_{x-1}^x f(u)du$$ Taking the derivative, we have that $f'(x) = f(x) - f(x-1)$. However, as $1 < x < 2$, $0 < x-1 < 1$, in which we know $f$ in the interval $(0,1)$. Therefore, using the result stated at the beginning, $f'(x) = f(x) - e^{x-1}$, as $f(x) = e^x$ in $(0,1)$. Rearranging this differential equation, we have $f'(x) - f(x) = -e^{x-1}$. Our initial condition is that $f(1) = e$, as this makes it continuous with the part of $f$ on $(0,1)$. This here is a first order linear differential equation that can be solved by integrating factors. Namely, the integrating factor here is $\\mu(t) = e^{\\int (-1)dx} = e^{-x}$. Multiplying by this on both sides yields $e^{-x}f'(x) - e^{-x}f(x) = -e^{-1}$. The LHS is just $(e^{-x}f(x))'$. Therefore, integrating both sides, $e^{-x}f(x) = \\displaystyle \\int -e^{-1}dx = -xe^{-1} + C$. Multiplying by $e^x$ on both sides, $f(x) = -xe^{x-1} + Ce^x$. We know that $f(1) = e$, so $e = -1 + Ce$, so $C = 1 + e^{-1}$. Therefore, $f(x) = -xe^{x-1} + \\left(1 + e^{-1}\\right)e^x$. Plugging in $x = 2$ yields $f(2) = e^2 - e$. Thus, $a = 1$ and $b = -1$, so $a + b = 0$.",

Therefore, we now want to select our paired rank as to minimize the probability of losing. In this case, we want to minimize the probability of four of a kind or a straight flush. The probability of a four of a kind is the same regardless of which two kicker cards we select, so this doesn't give us any information. However, we do want to minimize the probability of a straight flush. This means we want to select the rank that is involved in the most number of straights. There are fewer straight that involve Aces since we already selected $3$ Aces. Therefore, any rank possessing a straight involving Aces is eliminated. We see that $2-5$ and $10-K$ are all eliminated with this logic. The remaining ranks would be $6-9$, and one can check that there are equal amounts of straights involving each of these values and not Aces. Since no other full house can defeat our hand, we are indifferent to each of these $4$ hands. This means we would pick any of $AAA66,AAA77,AAA88,$ or $AAA99$ to be our hand.

    "hint": "Groups of $3^n$ are preferable throughout this problem.",
    "solution": "For this problem, we will first start off with the method used to solve this specific question and then show give a generalized form for any $n$ beans. As with any other \"Balanced Beans\" problem, we need to split the $90$ beans into three groups of $30$. The worst case scenario is that the balance is not balanced. Here is where it gets difficult: How do we go about checking the remaining $60$ beans? A popular method is to subdivide each group of beans into groups of powers of $3$. With $30$ beans in each group, we can divide them each up into a group of $27$ beans and a group of $3$ beans. Then, just like in \"Balanced Beans II\", we rotate the groups of $27$ beans around. The original groups were {{$27_A$, $3_A$}, {$27_B$, $3_B$}, {$27_C$, $3_C$}}. After the rotation, we have {{$27_C$, $3_A$}, {$27_A$, $3_B$}, {$27_B$, $3_C$}}. If the orientation of the balance doesn't change, then we know that the abnormal bean is a part of either $3_A$ or $3_B$. If the orientation did change, depending on how they changed, we can deduce which group of $27$ has the abnormal bean. The worse case is that the bean is a part of the $27$ group which from \"Balanced Beans III\", would take an extra 3 weighings. This makes our total 5 weighings. You may be wondering why we split the groups of $30$ into $27$ and $3$. This is because using the rotation method and having groups of $3^n$ allow us to not only identify whether the abnormal ball is heavier or lighter than the others but also be left with a group of $3^n$ which we have proved in \"Balanced Beans III\" to take $n$ weighings. Lets take another example. Say we starting with $120$ beans. We then split them into $3$ groups of $40$ and within the $40$, we can split them into groups of $27, 9, 3$ and $1$. No matter which group the abnormal bean is, it will take the same number of weighings as we start by rotating the largest groups and go onto the smallest. $27$ will take one more weighing than $9$ beans and thus the rotation of $9$ beans comes after the rotation of $27$. The generalization of this strategy becomes $\\text{ceiling}(\\log_{3}(2n+3))$ where $n$ is the amount of beans we have.",

    "task": "Coins $1$ and $2$ are weighted such that Coin $1$ has probability $0 < p_1 < 1$ of landing heads up and Coin $2$ has probability $0 < p_2 < 1$ of landing heads up. It is known that $p_1 + p_2 = 1$ and that $p_2 > p_1$. One of the coins is chosen randomly and then flipped twice. Both of the flips resulted in heads. If we know that it is now $4$ times as likely that we chose Coin $2$ as opposed to Coin $1$ given this information, find $p_2$.",
    "hint": "Let $C_2$ denote the event we selected Coin 2, $C_1$ denote the event we selected Coin 1, and $H$ denote the event we flipped 2 heads from the two flips. The information in the question says that $\\mathbb{P}[C_2 \\mid H] = 4\\mathbb{P}[C_1 \\mid H]$.",
    "solution": "We are going to solve this more generally for $k > 1$ times as likely. We are given that if there we select a coin at random and we receive $2$ heads, then it is $k$ times as likely that we picked Coin 2 than Coin 1. Thus, if we let $C_2$ denote the event we selected Coin 2, $C_1$ denote the event we selected Coin 1, and $H$ denote the event we flipped 2 heads from the two flips, $\\mathbb{P}[C_2 \\mid H] = k\\mathbb{P}[C_1 \\mid H]$ Writing this with conditional probability formula on both sides, we get the equality $$\\dfrac{\\mathbb{P}[C_2H]}{\\mathbb{P}[H]} = \\dfrac{\\mathbb{P}[C_1H]}{\\mathbb{P}[H]}$$ Cancellation of denominators gives $\\mathbb{P}[C_2H] = k\\mathbb{P}[C_1H]$. Rewriting with conditional probability again on both sides yields $$\\mathbb{P}[H \\mid C_2]\\mathbb{P}[C_2] = k\\mathbb{P}[H \\mid C_1]\\mathbb{P}[C_1]$$ However, since the two coins are selected at random, $\\mathbb{P}[C_1] = \\mathbb{P}[C_2]$. Thus, we have $\\mathbb{P}[H \\mid C_2] = k\\mathbb{P}[H \\mid C_1]$. This is now is a very workable expression. Now that each flip is independent, so $\\mathbb{P}[H \\mid C_2]$ is just the probability of a heads on Coin $2$ squared, which is just $p_2^2$. Similarly, since $p_1 + p_2 = 1$, $p_1 = 1-p_2$. Thus, the probability of 2 heads on Coin 1 is given by $(1-p_2)^2$. Therefore, we now have the equality $p_2^2 = k(1-p_2)^2 \\implies p_2^2 = kp_2^2 - 2kp_2 + k$. Rearranging to get $0$ on a side, we get $(k-1)p_2^2 - 2kp_2 + k = 0$. This is a polynomial in $p_2$. We use the quadratic formula to solve: $$p_2 = \\dfrac{-(-2k) \\pm \\sqrt{(-2k)^2 - 4(k-1)(k)}}{2(k-1)} = \\dfrac{2k \\pm \\sqrt{4k}}{2(k-1)}$$ Notice that we must use the $-$ branch of the square root here, as $2k > 2(k-1)$, so $\\dfrac{2k}{2(k-1)} > 1$, and a probability can not be larger than 1. Thus, we use the $-$ branch as our valid branch to solve for $p_2$, and we get that $p_2 = \\dfrac{k-\\sqrt{k}}{k-1}$. Plugging in $k = 4$, we obtain $p_2 = \\dfrac{2}{3}$.",

The five pirates agree on the following method to divide 100 gold coins. The most senior pirate will propose a distribution of the coins. All pirates five pirates vote on whether or not to pass the proposition. If at least 50% of the pirates accept the proposal, the gold is distributed accordingly. Else, the senior pirate is tossed overboard and the process restarts with the next most senior pirate. This method is repeated until a plan is approved. How many gold coins will the most senior pirate get, if any?",
    "hint": "Reduce this down to the $2-$pirate case to start and work your way up.",
    "solution": "In the 2-pirate case, the most senior pirate, denoted pirate 2, will distribute all of the gold to himself since he will always get at least 50% of the votes- thus, pirate 1 gets none. Let's add a more senior pirate, pirate 3. Pirate 3 understands that if his plan is voted down, then pirate 1 will not receive anything as the 3-pirate case turns into the 2-pirate case. Thus, pirate 3 offers pirate 1 one coin and keeps the remaining 99 coins. Pirate 3 votes for this and so will pirate 1, else he would receive nothing in the 2-pirate case. In the 4-pirate case, pirate 4 understands that if his plan is voted down, then pirate 2 will get nothing- pirate 2 will settle for one coin if pirate 4 offers him one coin. Thus, this proposition passes with votes from pirates 2 and 4. In the 5-pirate case, pirate 5 understands that if his plan is voted down, both pirate 3 and pirate 1 will get nothing. Therefore, he only needs to offer pirate 1 and pirate 3 one coin each to get their votes and keep the remaining 98 coins. This proposition passes with votes from pirates 1, 3, and 5.",

By independence, we can split this up to obtain $\\mathbb{P}[X_1 \\leq \\ln(n)]\\dots \\mathbb{P}[X_n \\leq \\ln(n)]$.

    "hint": "In total, there are $n$ line segments when the process is done. How many pairs of line segments are there to have intersections? How many of those pairs can't intersect? For the ones that can, what is the probability of intersection?",
    "solution": "In total, there are $n$ line segments when the process is done. This means that there are $\\displaystyle \\binom{n}{2}$ pairs of line segments that could possibly intersect. However, not all of these have equal probabilities of intersecting. In particular, each of the $n$ points selected represents the intersection of two line segments on the circumference of the circle, meaning that those two segments can't intersect inside the circle. Therefore, we must subtract $n$ possible pairs of line segments that could intersect, as those $n$ pairs can't intersect each other inside the circle. This yields $\\displaystyle \\binom{n}{2} - n$ possible pairs of line segments that can intersection. By linearity of expectation and the exchangeability of the remaining pairs, we just need to now find the probability of intersection between any two line segments to find the total number of expected intersections. Our question can be formalized as the following: Suppose that we have $X_1,X_2,X_3,$ and $X_4$ selected uniformly at random from the circumference of a circle. Draw a chord between $X_1$ and $X_2$ and a chord between $X_3$ and $X_4$. Find the probability that the chords intersect. Since the circle is rotationally invariant, we can just lock in $X_1$ at $(1,0)$. Then, we can consider all possible orderings of $X_2,X_3,$ and $X_4$ in terms of distance (radians CCW) from the origin. By drawing out the different permutations, you can see that there is an intersection between the segments if $X_2$ is between $X_3$ and $X_4$ (or vice versa). This corresponds to $2$ of the $3! = 6$ possible orderings of the random variables, so the probability is $1/3$. The above yields that the expected number of intersections is $\\dfrac{\\binom{n}{2} - n}{3} = \\dfrac{n(n-3)}{6}$. In particular, $n = 12$ here yields $18$ intersections on average.",

Therefore, instead of making jumps that decrease linearly (which is what we do in the two egg case), we are going to make jumps that decrease by the maximum increment of the two egg case. This is so that we are sufficiently able to search everything in a given range in the two egg case afterwards. Putting this into math, we want to find a first cutoff point such that if the egg breaks at floor $X$ on the first drop, we can examine the floors below it in $9-1 = 8$ trials. We can examine up to $\\dfrac{8 \\cdot 9}{2} = 36$ floors in $8$ trials by Egg Drop I, so we should drop our first egg at floor $37$. If it doesn't break, then we need to increment such that if it breaks on our next trial, we can examine the remaining space between $37$ and the next floor in $9-2 = 7$ drops. We can explore up to $\\dfrac{8 \\cdot 7}{2} = 28$ floors with $7$ drops, so we should place our next egg at floor $66$ such that we can explore floors $38-65$ ($28$ floors) in the remaining $7$ drops.

If it doesn't break, then if $n = 130$, we would know that the egg breaks at floor $130$, as it must break on one of the floors in our building. We can't explore any higher than $130$ due to the fact that if it breaks at some point above $130$, we would have to search between $129$ and the breaking point, which takes strictly more than one egg drop.

For example, you may remove $3$ and $5$ to replace it with $15$, increasing the sum to $137$. The question then becomes which integers can we do this for and not violate our condition. Let's start with taking out the $2$. This is natural since $2$ is our smallest integer besides $1$ in our subset. The closest we can get to $30$ with elements currently in the subset is $28$, as $2^2 \\cdot 7 = 28$. $29$ is already in our subset, and $30$ can't be added in presently, as $3$ and $5$ divide $30$. Therefore, we should replace $2$ and $7$ with $28$, increasing our sum by $19$ to $149$. Our remaining set is $$\\{1,3,5,11,13,17,19,23,28,29\\}$$ Afterwards, we note that $3^3 = 27$, and $27$ is still coprime to everything our in our set. Similarly, $5^2 = 25$ would also be coprime to everything else, so we make these substitutions as well.

    "hint": "Condition on the value of the $60-$sided die being $> 40$ or between $1$ and $40$.",
    "solution": "The trick here is to condition on whether or not the $60-$sided die is larger than $40$ or in the range $1,2,\\dots,40$. In the case where it is strictly larger than $40$, the $60-$sided die wins with probability $1$. This event occurs with probability $\\dfrac{1}{3}$. In the event that it is in the range $1,2,\\dots, 40$, then it is like we are rolling two identical dice. Therefore, we just need to find the probability that the $60-$sided die would be the one that is strictly larger. Conditioning on the fact that we are in the range $1,2,\\dots,40$, each of the two dice is equally likely to be strictly larger than the other. Therefore, we just need to subtract out the probability that they are equal and then divide by $2$. The probability they are equal is $\\dfrac{1}{40}$. This is because if we fix the first die arbitrarily, there is $1$ of $40$ equally likely values the second die that is equal to the first. Therefore, there is a $\\dfrac{39}{40}$ chance they are not equal. If they are not equal, it is equally likely for either of the two to be larger, so the probability that the larger one is the $60-$sided die is $\\dfrac{39}{80}$.

    "task": "There are two red cherries and five purple cherries in bowl $A$. There are six red cherries and three purple cherries in bowl $B$. If possible, Jenny randomly transfers a cherry from bowl $B$ into bowl $A$. Then, she randomly picks a cherry from bowl $A$ to eat. She repeats this process until all cherries are eaten. What is the probability that the last cherry she eats is red? Round your answer to 5 decimal places.",
    "hint": "First approach this problem by considering similar-colored cherries as distinguishable. Treat your bowls as sets such that: \\[\\begin{aligned} A &= \\{r_1, r_2, p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4, p_5\\}, \\\\ B &= \\{r_3, r_4, r_5, r_6, r_7, r_8, p_6, p_7, p_8\\}. \\end{aligned}\\] What is the the probability that $r_1$ is eaten last?",
    "solution": "Let's first approach this problem by considering similar-colored cherries as distinguishable. Treating our bowls as sets, we have:\\[\\begin{aligned} A &= \\{r_1, r_2, p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4, p_5\\}, \\\\ B &= \\{r_3, r_4, r_5, r_6, r_7, r_8, p_6, p_7, p_8\\}.\\end{aligned}\\]Let's find the probability that $r_1$ is eaten last (we will denote this event $R_1$). In order for $r_1$ to be eaten last, we need to eat $15$ cherries that are not $r_1$. Note that there are $8$ cherries to choose from in bowl $A$ until the $10$th round, which is when bowl $B$ is empty. Thus, \\[\\begin{aligned}\\mathbb{P}(R_1) &= \\left( \\frac{7}{8} \\right)^9 \\left( \\frac{6}{7} \\cdot \\frac{5}{6} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\\\&= \\left( \\frac{7}{8} \\right)^9 \\cdot \\frac{1}{7}\\end{aligned}\\]The probability that $r_3$ is eaten last (we will denote this event with $R_3$) is trickier to compute. Let $S_k$ denote the event that $r_3$ is the $k$-th cherry transferred from $B$ to $A$. Since each arrangement of the $9$ cherries in bowl $B$ occur with equal probability, $\\mathbb{P}(S_k) = \\frac{1}{9}$ for all $k \\in \\{1, \\ldots, 9\\}$. Note that if $S_k$, then there are $9 - k$ cherries remaining in bowl $B$ once $r_3$ is in bowl $A$. And once $r_3$ is in bowl $A$, we have a very similar problem to finding $\\mathbb{P}(R_1)$. \\[\\begin{aligned} \\mathbb{P}(R_3 | S_1) &= \\left( \\frac{7}{8} \\right)^8 \\left( \\frac{7}{8} \\cdot \\frac{6}{7} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\\\ &= \\left( \\frac{7}{8} \\right)^8 \\cdot \\frac{1}{8} \\\\ \\mathbb{P}(R_3 | S_2) &= \\left( \\frac{7}{8} \\right)^7 \\cdot \\frac{1}{8} \\\\ &\\vdots \\\\ \\mathbb{P}(R_3 | S_9) &= \\left( \\frac{7}{8} \\right)^0 \\cdot \\frac{1}{8} \\\\ &= \\frac{1}{8}\\end{aligned}\\]We can now compute $\\mathbb{P}(R_3)$ using the law of total probability. \\[\\begin{aligned} \\mathbb{P}(R_3) &= \\sum_{k = 1}^9 \\mathbb{P}(R_3 \\cap S_k) \\\\ &= \\sum_{k = 1}^9 \\mathbb{P}(R_3 | S_k) \\mathbb{P}(S_k)\\\\ &= \\frac{1}{8} \\sum_{k = 1}^9 \\mathbb{P}(R_3 | S_k) \\\\ &= \\frac{1}{8 \\cdot 9} \\left( \\sum_{k = 1}^9 \\left( \\frac{7}{8} \\right)^{k-1} \\right)\\end{aligned}\\]The summation can be computed as follows:\\[\\begin{aligned} \\sum_{k = 1}^9 \\left( \\frac{7}{8} \\right)^{k-1} &= \\frac{1 \\left((1 - \\left(\\frac{7}{8}\\right)^9 \\right)}{1 - \\frac{7}{8}} \\\\ &= 8 \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{7}{8}\\right)^9 \\right)\\end{aligned}\\] Substituting, we find\\[\\begin{aligned}\\mathbb{P}(R_3) &= \\frac{1}{9} \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{7}{8}\\right)^9 \\right)\\end{aligned}\\]We define $R_2$ in a similar way to $R_1$, and we define $R_4, \\ldots, R_8$ in a similar way to $R_3$. By symmetry, \\[\\begin{aligned}\\mathbb{P}(R_1) &= \\mathbb{P}(R_2), \\quad\\text{and} \\\\\\mathbb{P}(R_3) &= \\mathbb{P}(R_4) = \\cdots = \\mathbb{P}(R_8).\\end{aligned}\\]$R_1, R_2, \\ldots, R_8$ are mutually exclusive events, meaning that we are free to use countable additivity. So, the probability of eating a red cherry last is\\[\\begin{aligned} \\mathbb{P}\\left( \\bigcup_{k = 1}^8 R_k \\right) &= \\sum_{k = 1}^8 \\mathbb{P} \\left( R_k \\right) \\\\ &= \\frac{2}{7} \\left( \\frac{7}{8} \\right)^9 + \\frac{2}{3} \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{7}{8}\\right)^9 \\right) \\\\ &= \\frac{27789631}{50331648} \\end{aligned}\\]",

    "hint": "Let $X_i$ be the indicator that person $i$ has a distinct birthday from the rest.",
    "solution": "Let $X_1,X_2,\\dots, X_N$ be the indicators of the event that the $i$th person, $1 \\leq i \\leq N$, has a distinct birthday distinct from the other $N-1$ people. Then $T = X_1 + \\dots + X_N$ gives the total number of distinct birthdays in the year. Then $b(N) = \\mathbb{E}[T] = N \\mathbb{E}[X_1]$ by linearity of expectation and the fact that each person is equally likely to have a distinct birthday from everyone else. $\\mathbb{E}[X_1]$ is the probability that person $1$ has a distinct birthday from everyone else. Fix the birthday of person $1$. Then the other $N-1$ people must have a birthday on the other $364$ days of the year, so the probability all of them do is $\\left(\\dfrac{364}{365}\\right)^{N-1}$. Therefore, $$b(N) = \\mathbb{E}[T] = N \\cdot \\left(\\dfrac{364}{365}\\right)^{N-1}$$. The question implies that there are two integer values of $n$ that yield the same value of $b(n)$. We can note that $b(n)$ is increasing for a while and then decreasing. Therefore, the two values of $n$ must be consecutive. Thus, we just need to find a value $n'$ such that $b(n') = b(n'+1)$. Our answer would then be $n' + (n'+1) = 2n' + 1$. The equation $b(n') = b(n' + 1)$ means $$n' \\cdot \\left(\\dfrac{364}{365}\\right)^{n' - 1} = (n' + 1) \\left(\\dfrac{364}{365}\\right)^{n'} \\iff n' = \\dfrac{364}{365}n' + \\dfrac{364}{365} \\iff n' = 364$$ Therefore, our answer is $2 \\cdot 364 + 1 = 729$.",

How many seconds after Alice passes Carter would Bob pass Carter?",

Alice starts a distance $3d$ behind Carter, so $\\dfrac{3d}{v_A - v_C} = 12$, as it takes Alice a total of $12$ minutes from the instant to pass Carter. We want to find $t = \\dfrac{2d}{v_B - v_C}$, the time it takes for Bob to catch up to Carter. We have that $d = 7(v_A - v_B) = 4(v_A - v_C) = \\dfrac{t}{2}(v_B - v_C)$ by rearranging the equations above. However, note that $$v_B - v_C = (v_A - v_C) - (v_A - v_B) = \\dfrac{d}{4} - \\dfrac{d}{7} = \\dfrac{3}{28}d$$ Therefore, we have that $d = \\dfrac{t}{2} \\cdot \\dfrac{3d}{28} = \\dfrac{3dt}{56}$, so $t = \\dfrac{56}{3}$.

Every minute, a car is considered eligible to move forward one space if a) the space in front of them is empty prior to any potential moves and b) label of the space they are on is less than $4$. Suppose that every minute, if a car is eligible to move, it moves forward one space with probability $1/2$.

The first step is that we need the car in space $2$ to move to space $3$. This takes $2$ minutes on average, so $E_{12} = 2 + E_{13}$. Now, from this state, there are three possibilities that occur with equal probability: the car in space $1$ moves before the car in space $3$, the car in space $3$ moves before the car in space $1$, or the cars both move at the same time. We will use Law of Total Expectation to condition on which of the cars moves first from this state. You can prove these are equally probable by computing $\\mathbb{P}[X = Y]$, where $X,Y \\sim \\text{Geom}(1/2)$ IID and using the exchangeability of the random variables. Furthermore, we use the result of First Flip to say $\\mathbb{E}[X \\mid X < Y] = \\mathbb{E}[X \\mid X = Y] = \\dfrac{4}{3}$. Taking these for granted, let's compute the conditional expectation in each case. $\\textbf{Space 1 Moves Before Space 3:}$ In this case, we reach a state where the cars are in spaces $2$ and $3$. By the first fact above, it takes an average of $\\dfrac{4}{3}$ minutes for the first car to move conditioned on this. Then, the car in space $3$ needs to move to space $4$, taking an average of $2$ minutes. Lastly, the car in space $2$ needs to move to space $3$, taking an average of $2$ minutes as well. The expected time in this case to reach the end is $\\dfrac{4}{3} + 2 + 2 = \\dfrac{16}{3}$. $\\textbf{Space 3 Moves Before Space 2:}$ In this case, we reach a state where the cars are in spaces $1$ and $4$. By the first fact above, it takes an average of $\\dfrac{4}{3}$ minutes for the car in space $3$ to move conditioned on this. Then, the car in space $1$ needs to move to space $3$, which means it must move from space $1$ to $2$ and then $2$ to $3$. This takes an average of $2$ minutes per space, meaning the expected time to reach the end in this case is $\\dfrac{4}{3} + 4 = \\dfrac{16}{3}$. $\\textbf{Both Move Simultaneously:}$ In this case, we reach a state where the cars are in spaces $2$ and $4$. It again takes an average of $\\dfrac{4}{3}$ minutes for the cars to move conditioned on this. Then, all that needs to occur is a movement of the car in space $2$ to space $3$, which takes $2$ minutes on average. Therefore, the expected time to reach the end in this case is $\\dfrac{4}{3} + 2 = \\dfrac{10}{3}$. By the Law of Total Expectation, $E_{13} = \\dfrac{1}{3}\\left(\\dfrac{16}{3} + \\dfrac{16}{3} + \\dfrac{10}{3}\\right) = \\dfrac{14}{3}$.

In other words, the probability that the minimum distance between two values is at least $x$ is that. Now, recall the identity for non-negative real-valued continuous random variables that $\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\displaystyle \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\mathbb{P}[X \\geq x]dx$.

    "hint": "If we want to reach position $k$, what are the possible positions we can reach it from? From those positions, how many steps need to be taken to reach position $k$? You may consider deriving a second-order recurrence relation for $p_k$.",
    "solution": "We want to maximize $p_k$. We are going to explicitly solve for $p_k$. We know that the frog jumps $1$ or $2$ steps at each time. Therefore, for position $k$, we can only reach it from positions $k-1$ or $k-2$. Namely, by Law of Total Probability, $p_k = \\dfrac{1}{2}p_{k-1} + \\dfrac{1}{2}p_{k-2}$. The $\\dfrac{1}{2}$ represents the probability of selecting $1$ or $2$ steps when at position $k-1$ and $k-2$, respectively. This is a homogeneous second-order recurrence relation with constant coefficients. We can see this by rearranging to get $-p_k + \\dfrac{1}{2}p_{k-1} + \\dfrac{1}{2}p_{k-2} = 0$. The characteristic polynomial is $-r^2 + \\dfrac{1}{2}r + \\dfrac{1}{2} = 0$. By multiplying both sides by $-2$, this is equivalent to $2r^2 - r - 1 = 0$. By using the quadratic equation, the roots are $r = 1, -\\dfrac{1}{2}$. Therefore, our solution is in the form $p_k = c_0 + c_1\\left(-\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)^k$. We need some initial conditions on this. Namely, it is very easy to calculate $p_0$ and $p_1$. We have that $p_0 = 1$ as we start at $0$. Additionally, $p_1 = \\dfrac{1}{2}$ since we must take $1$ step starting from $0$ to reach it. Otherwise, we do not hit it. We get the system of equations $c_0 + c_1 = 1$ and $c_0 - \\dfrac{1}{2}c_1 = \\dfrac{1}{2}$. It is simple enough to verify that $c_0 = \\dfrac{2}{3}$ and $c_1 = \\dfrac{1}{3}$ solve this system.

Therefore, to maximize this probability, we want to maximize how positive $\\left(-\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)^k$ is for $k > 0$. Namely, we just want $k$ to be as small as possible and even, as evenness makes it positive and $k$ being the smallest even one makes the term as large as possible over the positive integers. The smallest positive integer is $k = 2$, so $k = 2$ will maximize $p_k$. Namely, $p_2 = \\dfrac{3}{4}$, and this is our solution.",

    "solution": "The trick here is to really work backwards. Note that if the player is the $i$th to flip the coin, his money will be doubled $7-i$ times after he flips. Therefore, after obtaining his heads and paying out the sum to each of the other players, the $i$th player to flip must have $\\dfrac{1.28}{2^{7-i}}$ in the bank. Furthermore, note that there is always $\\$1.28 \\cdot 7 = \\$8.96$ in the game at all turns. Starting with player $A$, this means player $A$ must have $2$ cents in the bank after he flips. This means that $x_1 - (8.96 - x_1) = 0.02$, as $x_1$ is what he had before the flip and $8.96 - x_1$ is what he pays out. Solving this yields $x_1 = 4.49$. For player $B$, we are going to calculate what he has right before he pays out everyone. We didn't need to worry about this when calculating $x_1$ as there was nobody before player $A$. If $p_2$ is what player $B$ has right before paying out, then $p_2 - (8.96 - p_2) = 0.04$, meaning $p_2 = 4.50$. Since player $B$ has his money doubled once already, this means $x_2 = 2.25$. More generally, if $p_k$ is what the $k$th person to flip had in their bank right before paying out, $p_k - (8.96 - p_k) = 1.28 \\cdot 2^{-(7-k)}$, meaning that $$p_k = \\dfrac{1.28 \\cdot 2^{-(7-k)} + 8.96}{2}$$ However, this person already had their money doubled $k-1$ times from the $k-1$ people that came before them, so this implies that $$x_k = \\dfrac{1.28 \\cdot 2^{-(7-k)} + 8.96}{2^k}$$ Plugging in $k = 1,2,\\dots, 7$ yields that $$x_1 = 4.49, x_2 = 2.25, x_3 = 1.13, x_4 = 0.57, x_5 = 0.29, x_6 = 0.15, x_7 = 0.08$$ Adding the squared values up and multiplying by $10000$ yields the result of $269374$.",

The optimal strategy here is a mixed strategy, where you select a random value $X$ from some appropriately determined distribution. Find $\\text{Var}(X)$.",
    "hint": "Suppose you were planning to select a value $n$. Note that $n+3$ is strictly better than $n$, as $n+3$ will beat all integers $n$ would beat, as well as the integer $n+2$. Therefore, whenever you can select $n$, you should select $n+3$.",
    "solution": "Suppose you were planning to select a value $n$. Note that $n+3$ is strictly better than $n$, as $n+3$ will beat all integers $n$ would beat, as well as the integer $n+2$. Therefore, whenever you can select $n$, you should select $n+3$. This means that your strategy should be to select $98,99,$ or $100$ with some probabilities. By the symmetry of the game, your friend should also select those values with the same probabilities. In particular, if you select $98-100$ with equal probability, no matter what probabilities your friend selects $98,99,$ and $100$ with, the expected payout for each player is $0$ by symmetry. This is because we see that $98$ is beat by $99$, $99$ is beat by $100$, and $100$ is beat by $98$, so each of the three outcomes is dominated by one other outcome. Furthermore, if you select a non-uniform distribution on $98,99,100$ for your values, there exists a strategy your friend can select that yields positive expected payout for them. The probabilities of selecting each of the values for you would be $p_1,p_2,$ and $1-p_1-p_2$. For a numerical demonstration, say $p_1 = 1/5$ and $p_2 = 1/2$. Then your friend should always select the value that maximizes their probability of winning. In this case, they should select $100$, as the expected payout would be $$(-1) \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{5} + (1) \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{2} + (0) \\cdot \\dfrac{3}{10} > 0$$ Namely, if $x$ is the value assigned to probability $\\text{max}\\{p_1,p_2,1-p_1-p_2\\}$, then your friend should always select the value that beats $x$. Therefore, to eliminate this opportunity, you should select a uniform distribution among $98-100$. This means $X \\sim \\text{DiscreteUnif}(\\{98,99,100\\})$, so $\\mathbb{E}[X] = 99$ and $\\text{Var}(X) = \\dfrac{(98-99)^2 + (99-99)^2 + (100-99)^2}{3} = \\dfrac{2}{3}$.",

Our profit after $n$ rolls would be $P_n = \\text{max}\\{X_1,\\dots,X_n\\} - (n-1)$, as we are paid the maximum of the $n$ rolls and we pay $n-1$ for the re-rolls. For convenience, let $M_n = \\text{max}\\{X_1,\\dots,X_n\\}$. We can use the property for non-negative integer-valued random variables that $\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\displaystyle \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\mathbb{P}[X \\geq k]$. As the largest possible value is $20$, we can say that $\\displaystyle \\mathbb{E}[M_n] = \\sum_{k=1}^{20} \\mathbb{P}[M_n \\geq k]$. To evaluate $\\mathbb{P}[M_n \\geq k]$, it is easier to evaluate via the complement, as the maximum being less than a certain value means all of them are less than that value, and then we can use independence. Namely, as $M_n$ is integer-valued, $\\mathbb{P}[M_n \\geq k] = 1 - \\mathbb{P}[M_n < k] = 1 - \\mathbb{P}[M_n \\leq k-1]$. $M_n$ being at most $k-1$ means all of $X_1,\\dots, X_n$ are at most $k-1$. The probability this occurs for each roll is $\\dfrac{k-1}{20}$. Therefore, $\\mathbb{P}[M_n \\geq k] = 1 - \\left(\\dfrac{k-1}{20}\\right)^n$. Plugging this in, $$\\mathbb{E}[M_n] = \\displaystyle \\sum_{k=1}^{20} \\left(1 - \\left(\\dfrac{k-1}{20}\\right)^n\\right) = 20 - \\dfrac{1}{20^n}\\sum_{k=0}^{19} k^n$$ The summation comes from an index shift by $1$.

We can note that $\\mathbb{E}[M_n - M_{n-1}]$, the increase in our expected value of consecutive roll numbers, decreases as $n$ increases. This is because the maximum grows with smaller and smaller probabilities each time. Therefore, if we can find where $\\mathbb{E}[P_n]$ starts to decrease, we have found our maximum, as it will never rise after.The first few values by direct substitution and evaluating using our known summation formulas are $\\mathbb{E}[P_1] = \\dfrac{21}{2}, \\mathbb{E}[P_2] = \\dfrac{513}{40}, \\mathbb{E}[P_3] = \\dfrac{1079}{80}, \\mathbb{E}[P_4] = \\dfrac{1078667}{80000}$.

    "task": "Suppose that you flip a coin $n$ times and it turns out that no consecutive heads appear in the sequence. Let $E(n)$ be the expected number of heads that appear given this information. Compute $\\displaystyle \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\dfrac{E(n)}{n}$. The answer is in the form $\\dfrac{a}{b + \\sqrt{c}}$ for integers $a,b,$ and $c$ with $c$ minimal. Find $abc$.",
    "hint": "Break it up into steps. First, compute the conditional probability the sequence starts with $H$. Then, derive a second-order recurrence for $E(n)$ with $A(n)$ as coefficients. Then, suppose $E(n) \\sim cn$ and compute $c$.",
    "solution": "We are going to combine a lot of different results in this question, specifically from Fibonacci Limit I and II. Let $A(n)$ be the number of sequences of length $n$ with no consecutive heads. Then $A(1) = 2$ and $A(2) = 3$ (only $HH$ doesn't satisfy this). For a sequence of length $n$ to satisfy our constraint, it either starts with $T$ or $HT$. It can't start with $HH$, as that would violate the condition. There are $A(n-1)$ sequences starting with $T$ that satisfy this condition, as the first flip is $T$ and the other $n-1$ spots must not contain any consecutive heads. There are $A(n-2)$ sequences starting with $HT$ by the same logic with with $n-2$ remaining spots. Thus, $A(n) = A(n-1) + A(n-2)$ with $A(1) = 2$ and $A(2) = 3$. This is just the Fibonacci sequence shifted. For the purposes of this question, the exact shift will not matter. All that matters is the amount of shift of the numerator relative to the denominator. We can now derive a recurrence relation for $E(n)$. If the first flip is $T$, which occurs with probability $\\dfrac{A(n-1)}{A(n)}$ conditional on there being no consecutive heads ($A(n-1)$ of the $A(n)$ total sequences start with $T$ by the previous paragraph), the expected number of heads is $E(n-1)$, as the first flip is $T$ and we count the number of heads in the remaining $n-1$ spots. Otherwise, if the first flip is $H$, which occurs with probability $\\dfrac{A(n-2)}{A(n)}$, then the expected number of heads is $1 + E(n-2)$, as we obtain $1$ head from the first flip, the second flip must be a tails, and then we count the expected number of heads in the other $n-2$ flips. We also get that $E(1) = 1/2$ and $E(2) = 2/3$ by listing out the valid sequences and counting the number of heads appearing in them. Therefore, we have the following recurrence for $E(n)$: $$E(n) = \\dfrac{A(n-1)}{A(n)} E(n-1) + \\dfrac{A(n-2)}{A(n)}\\left(1 + E(n-2)\\right)$$ Note that this is a non-homogenous and non-constant coefficient second order recurrence, so it is very unlikely a nice closed form exists. However, we can get asymptotics on $E(n)$. Suppose that $E(n) \\sim cn$ as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$. Our goal is to find $c$. At this point, we use Fibonacci Limit I and II. For large $n$ we know that $\\dfrac{A(n)}{A(n-1)} \\rightarrow \\phi$, the golden ratio $\\phi = \\dfrac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$, so $\\dfrac{A(n-1)}{A(n)} \\rightarrow \\dfrac{1}{\\phi}$. Similarly, $\\dfrac{A(n-2)}{A(n)} \\rightarrow \\dfrac{1}{\\phi + 1}$. Therefore, in limit, we need to find $c$ such that $$cn = \\dfrac{1}{\\phi} c(n-1) + \\dfrac{1}{\\phi+1}(1 + c(n-2)) \\iff c\\left(\\dfrac{1}{\\phi} + \\dfrac{2}{\\phi+1}\\right) = \\dfrac{1}{\\phi+1} \\iff c = \\dfrac{1}{\\phi+2} = \\dfrac{2}{5 + \\sqrt{5}}$$ Thus, the answer is $5 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 2 = 50$.",

By the independent increments property of the Poisson Process, the remaining terms inside are independent of $S_s$, so the conditional expectation becomes unconditional.

Note how the bags labeled \"apple\" and \"orange\" are symmetric, and thus we choose a fruit from the \"mix\" bag. Without loss of generality, if the fruit we get is an apple, then we know that the \"mix\" bag is truly the \"apple\" bag. We are left to identify the true \"mix\" and \"orange\" labels from the mislabeled \"apple\" and \"orange\" bags.

There are $5$ remaining values in this sample space that are equally probable, so the number of rolls needed to see a $6$ conditional on this information is $\\text{Geom}(1/5)$, which has mean $5$.

    "solution": "An incorrect solution goes as follows: Since we want the first $6$ to appear before the first $5$, we can eliminate $5$ from our sample space and look at the reduced sample space conditional on no roll being a $5$. There are $5$ remaining values in this sample space that are equally probable, so the number of rolls needed to see a $6$ conditional on this information is $\\text{Geom}(1/5)$, which has mean $5$. Therefore, the answer is $5$ This above solution is incorrect because it more implicitly assumes that we just \"ignore\" $5$s that appear. Therefore, this is not the correct assumption we want to make. Let's let $N$ represent the number of rolls needed to see a $6$, and let $B$ be the event that $6$ occurs before $5$. By symmetry, $\\mathbb{P}[B] = 1/2$. We now condition on the value of the first roll. Let $R_i$ represent the event that we roll value $i$ on the first roll. This would imply by Law of Total Expectation that $$\\mathbb{E}[N \\mid B] = \\sum_{i=1}^6 \\mathbb{E}[N \\mid R_i,B]\\mathbb{P}[R_i \\mid B]$$ For $i = 1,2,3,4$, we have that $\\mathbb{P}[R_i \\mid B] = \\dfrac{P[B \\mid R_i]\\mathbb{P}[R_i]}{\\mathbb{P}[B]}$. Since the event that we roll $i = 1,2,3,4$ on the first roll doesn't affect the probability of appearance of $6$ before $5$, we have that $\\mathbb{P}[B \\mid R_i] = \\mathbb{P}[B]$. Clearly $\\mathbb{P}[R_i] = 1/6$ based on the fact the die is fair, so $\\mathbb{P}[R_i \\mid B] = 1/6$ for $i = 1,2,3,4$. We have that $\\mathbb{P}[R_5 \\mid B] = 0$, as there is no chance that our first roll can be $5$ is $6$ comes before $5$. Thus, since the conditional probability measure is a probability measure, we have that $\\mathbb{P}[R_6 \\mid B] = 1 - 4 \\cdot 1/6 = 1/3$. If we roll a $6$ on the first roll, then we get it in $1$ roll, so $\\mathbb{E}[N \\mid B,R_6] = 1$. Otherwise, if $i = 1,2,3,4$, then $\\mathbb{E}[N \\mid B,R_i] = 1 + \\mathbb{E}[N \\mid B]$, as we used up one roll and need to continue forward. Therefore, the equation we need to solve is $$\\mathbb{E}[N \\mid B] = \\dfrac{2}{3}\\left(1 + \\mathbb{E}[N \\mid B]\\right) + \\dfrac{1}{3}$$ This is easily solved to yield $\\mathbb{E}[N \\mid B] = 3$. You can instead view this problem as saying that whenever we roll a $5$ or $6$, we make it a $6$ so that the $6$ occurs before the $5$. Therefore, the probability of rolling a $5$ or $6$ on each trial is $1/3$, meaning that $N \\mid B \\sim \\text{Geom}(1/3)$, which has mean $3$. This agrees with the answer above.",

    "task": "What is the smallest positive integer that ends with the digit $4$ such that moving its last digit to the first position (i.e. 1234 => 4123) multiplies the original integer by exactly $4$?",
    "hint": "Note here that the first digit of our integer must be $1$, as when multiplied by $4$, the first digit must now be $4$. Try writing out the decimal expansions, rearranging, and see what you notice about the LHS term and what it implies for the RHS.",
    "solution": "Clearly the integer isn't $4$, so it has at least $2$ digits. Suppose it has exactly $2$ digits. Then it is in the form $a4$ for some integer $a$. We would want $4(10a + 4) = 40 + a$, as $40 + a$ is the representation of $4a$. This would mean that $39a = 24$ which is not possible. Note here that the first digit of our integer must be $1$, as when multiplied by $4$, the first digit must now be $4$. Therefore, for three digits, we can see that the form is $1a4$ for an integer $a$. We would need to have that $4(104 + a) = 410 + a$, so $3a = -6$. This is not possible, as our integer must be non-negative. Next, suppose it has $4$ digits. Therefore, it is in the form $1ab4$. We would need to satisfy $4(1004 + 100a + 10b) = 4100 + 10a + b$, which would imply that $390a + 39b = 84$. This is not possible, as $39 \\nmid 84$. We are starting to see a pattern here. The integer on the RHS with $n$ non-fixed digits is $4 \\cdot 10^n + 10^{n-1}$, whereas the integer on the LHS is $4 \\cdot 10^n + 16$. Therefore, we need to find the smallest $n$ such that their difference, which is $10^{n-1} - 16$, is divisible by $39$. The terms on the LHS, before division, are all $39 \\cdot 10^k$ for $0 \\leq k \\leq n-1$. Try equating this representation to the example above. For $n = 3$, this number is $984$, which is not divisible by $39$. However, for $n = 4$, the number on the RHS is $9984 = 39 \\cdot 256$. Therefore, the number must be in the form $1abcd4$, as we have $4$ free digits in the middle. Then, the equation we need to satisfy in the non-negative integers is $$39000a + 3900b + 390c + 39d = 9984$$ Clearly $a = 0$, as everything must be non-negative. Dividing by $39$, we see that $100b + 10c + d = 256 = 100 \\cdot 2 + 10 \\cdot 5 + 6$, which clearly yields $a = 0, b=2, c = 5, d = 6$. Therefore, our answer is $102564$. We can quickly verify that $410256 = 4 \\cdot 102564$.",

Similarly, we know that $\\text{Var}(X+Y) = \\sigma_X^2 + \\sigma_Y^2 + 2\\sigma_X\\sigma_Y = (\\sigma_X + \\sigma_Y)^2$, so $\\sigma_{X+Y} = \\sigma_X + \\sigma_Y$.

We get the $-1$ from the condition that $\\sigma_Y > \\sigma_X$, so the numerator is negative. Another way to see this is that if $X$ and $Y$ are perfectly correlated, then $Y = aX + b$ for some constants $a$ and $b$. Since $\\sigma_Y > \\sigma_X$, it must be the case that $|a| > 1$. Therefore, $X+Y = X(1+a) + b$ and $X-Y = X(1-a) + b$. As $|a| > 1$, one of the constants between $1+a$ and $1-a$ is positive and one is negative. Therefore, as these are both linear transformation of $X$ with opposing signs, they must have correlation $-1$.",

    "hint": "The key here is to note that since the targets are of extremely small radius, we can essentially treat them as points. How do we account for difference in radii? How do we account for the $3$ targets instead of $2$?",
    "solution": "The key here is to note that since the targets are of extremely small radius, we can essentially treat them as points. The approximate probability we hit target $A$ would be approximately $f(x_A)\\varepsilon$, where $f(x_A)$ is the probability density at point $A$. However, since $B$ is also of small radius $2\\varepsilon$, the probability we hit target $B$ is approximately $2f(x_B)\\varepsilon$. Likewise, the probability we hit target $C$ is approximately $3f(x_C)\\varepsilon$. Since the targets are disjoint, our goal is to maximize the weighted sum of the probability densities. Our probability density here is dependent on what $\\mu$ we select. Therefore, as a function of $\\mu$, we need to maximize $$f(\\mu) = \\dfrac{1}{2\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\left(e^{-\\frac{(-1-\\mu)^2}{8}} + 2e^{-\\frac{(3-\\mu)^2}{8}} + 3e^{-\\frac{(5-\\mu)^2}{8}}\\right)$$ The interior terms are just the density of a $N(\\mu,4)$ distribution at $-1, 3,$ and $5$, respectively. To do this, we take the derivative and set it equal to $0$. In particular, $$f'(\\mu) = \\dfrac{1}{2\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\left[\\dfrac{-1-\\mu}{4}e^{-\\frac{(-1-\\mu)^2}{8}} + \\dfrac{3-\\mu}{2}e^{-\\frac{(3-\\mu)^2}{8}} + 3 \\cdot \\dfrac{5-\\mu}{4}e^{-\\frac{(5-\\mu)^2}{8}}\\right] = 0$$ Using a computer system, $f'(\\mu) = 0$ for $\\mu \\approx 4.211$. One can verify that this is indeed a maxima, so $4.21$ is our answer. This intuitively makes sense, as the increased size of the region around $3$ and $5$ means that we should assign more density there. Furthermore, the region around $5$ is slightly larger than the region around $3$, so the center should be placed closer to $5$ than $3$.",

To put this strategy in a mathematical context, the optimal ratio will be $\\dfrac{n+1}{2n+1}$ where n is a number from 0 to infinity. Thus we should always end on an odd roll. To find the expectation, we need to find a weighted sum of this series, the weight being the probability we end on $2n+1$.

What remains is to calculate that expectation. To calculate $\\mathbb{E}[X_iI_{N \\geq i}]$, it is easiest to condition on the value of $X_i$. This is because of the fact that it is easy to evaluate the probability all of the remaining values are at least $X_i$ from this. Therefore, $\\mathbb{E}[X_iI_{N \\geq i}] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{E}[X_iI_{N \\geq i} \\mid X_i]] = \\mathbb{E}[X_i\\mathbb{E}[I_{N \\geq i} \\mid X_i]]$. This expectation on the inside evaluates to the probability that given $X_i$, $1 > X_1 > \\dots X_{i-1} > X_i$. The probability all of the first $i-1$ random variables are at least as large as $X_i$ is $(1 - X_i)^{i-1}$, as it occurs with probability $1 - X_i$ independently for each random variable. The probability that $X_1 > X_2 > \\dots > X_{i-1}$ is $\\dfrac{1}{(i-1)!}$, as there are $(i-1)!$ equally likely orderings of the IID values and this is one of them. Therefore, as the ordering and the restriction on the minimum value are independent, $\\mathbb{E}[I_{N \\geq i} \\mid X_i] = \\dfrac{(1-X_i)^{i-1}}{(i-1)!}$. Therefore, $\\mathbb{E}[X_iI_{N \\geq i}] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\dfrac{X_i(1-X_i)^{i-1}}{(i-1)!}\\right]$.

Using this, we can sum the series: $$\\mathbb{E}[S] = \\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\dfrac{1}{2^i(i+1)!} = 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\dfrac{1}{2^{i+1}(i+1)!} = 2\\sum_{i=2}^{\\infty} \\dfrac{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^i}{i!}$$ This last sum is just that of $\\sqrt{e}$ without the $i = 0$ and $i = 1$ terms. Therefore, that sum evaluates to $\\sqrt{e} - 1 - \\dfrac{1}{2 \\cdot 1!} = \\sqrt{e} - \\dfrac{3}{2}$. Substituting this in, $\\mathbb{E}[S] = 2\\sqrt{e} - 3$.

    "task": "You have two fair $6-$sided dice. At each round, you roll both dice and record the upfaces. Find the expected number of rounds you need to perform to observe all $6$ faces of the dice.",
    "hint": "The key here is to set up a Markov chain. Let $e_i$ be the expected number of rounds it takes given you already have $i$ distinct faces. We want $e_0$. The boundary condition is that $e_6 = 0$, as we would already be done at that point.",
    "solution": "The key here is to set up a Markov chain. Let $e_i$ be the expected number of rounds it takes given you already have $i$ distinct faces. We want $e_0$. The boundary condition is that $e_6 = 0$, as we would already be done at that point. We can work backwards on this. We would have that $e_5 = 1 + \\dfrac{25}{36}e_5 + \\dfrac{11}{36}e_6$. This is because if we already have $5$ values, then with probability $\\dfrac{5}{6}$ per die we roll a value that has already been rolled. This doesn't contribute to anything further, so $e_5 = \\dfrac{36}{11}$ after rearranging. We would have that $e_4 = 1 + \\dfrac{16}{36}e_4 + \\dfrac{18}{36}e_5+ \\dfrac{2}{36}e_6$ because of the fact that if we have $4$ values, with probability $\\dfrac{4}{6}$ per die we roll a value we have already seen. We get the $\\dfrac{2}{36}$ from the fact that the first die has $2$ values that could appear that are new and only $1$ new value for the last one. As the probabilities must sum to $1$, the coefficient of $e_5$ must be $\\dfrac{18}{36}$. Substituting in, we get that $e_4 = \\dfrac{271}{55}$. Continuing this pattern, we have that $e_3 = 1 + \\dfrac{9}{36}e_3 + \\dfrac{21}{36}e_4 + \\dfrac{6}{36}e_5$ by similar logic to the above. For example, to get $2$ new distinct values, there are $3$ values the first die can take and $2$ values the second can take. Plugging in the prior values gives $e_3 = \\dfrac{949}{165}$. The equations for the remaining values are \\[ \\begin{aligned} &e_2 = 1 + \\dfrac{4}{36}e_2 + \\dfrac{20}{36}e_3 + \\dfrac{12}{36}e_4 \\\\ &e_1 = 1 + \\dfrac{1}{36}e_1 + \\dfrac{15}{36}e_2 + \\dfrac{20}{36}e_3 \\\\ &e_0 = 1 + \\dfrac{1}{6}e_1 + \\dfrac{5}{6}e_2 \\end{aligned} \\] When finishing up the solving of the system above, the final result is $e_0 = \\dfrac{70219}{9240} \\approx 7.6$. This is just above the $7.35$ that you get if you were to divide the solution for one die $(14.7)$ by two. This is a good sanity check.",

    "task": "You are given $3$ IID $\\text{Unif}(0,1)$ random variables but can't see the values. One of the values is revealed to you at random among the three. You want to determine if the revealed value is the minimum, median, or maximum of the three values. Assuming you guess optimally, what is your probability of being correct?",
    "hint": "The optimal strategy is going to be in the form of guessing the minimum if the value is $\\leq x$, median if the value is between $x$ and $y$, and maximum if the value if $\\geq y$. However, note that $y = 1-x$ because of the fact that if $X_1,X_2,X_3 \\sim \\text{Unif}(0,1)$ IID, $1 - X_1, 1- X_2, 1-X_3 \\sim \\text{Unif}(0,1)$ IID as well, so the threshold for guessing the maximum would be $1-x$.",
    "solution": "The optimal strategy is going to be in the form of guessing the minimum if the value is $\\leq x$, median if the value is between $x$ and $y$, and maximum if the value if $\\geq y$.

Now, we need to find $p(x)$, the probability as a function of $x$ of guessing correctly under this rule. There are three cases to consider, which is if the value if $\\leq x$, between $x$ and $1-x$, and then $\\geq 1-x$. The first and third cases we can treat as the same by the same argument as above. The probability of the revealed value being at most $x$ is $x$. Then, given the value is in $(0,x)$, it is uniform on that interval. Say $X_1$ is the value showed to us. By conditioning on $X_1 = a$, $$\\displaystyle \\mathbb{P}[X_1 = \\text{min}\\{X_1,X_2,X_3\\}] = \\int_0^x \\mathbb{P}[X_1 = \\text{min}\\{X_1,X_2,X_3\\} \\mid X_1 = a]f_{X_1}(a)da = \\dfrac{1}{x}\\int_0^x (1-a)^2da = \\dfrac{1}{3}a^2 -a+1$$ The $(1-a)^2$ term comes from the probability both $X_2$ and $X_3$ are larger than $a$. Multiplying by the probability of $X_1 \\leq a$ and doubling to account for the third case, we get a term of $2a\\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}a^2 - a + 1\\right)$ for our final probability. Now, we account for the middle case, which occurs with probability $1-2a$. If $X_1$ is in this interval, it is uniform throughout it. Therefore, conditioning on $X_1 = a$ once again, we would now guess $X_1$ is the median, so $$\\mathbb{P}[X_1 = \\text{med}\\{X_1,X_2,X_3\\}] = \\displaystyle \\int_x^{1-x} \\mathbb{P}[X_1 = \\text{med}\\{X_1,X_2,X_3\\} \\mid X_1 = a]f_{X_1}(a)da = \\dfrac{1}{1-2x} \\int_x^{1-x} 2a(1-a)da = -\\dfrac{2}{3}x^2 + \\dfrac{2}{3}x + \\dfrac{1}{3}$$ The $2a(1-a)$ term comes from the fact that one of the remaining two random variables is above and the other is below $a$ with $2$ ways to order them. Multiplying by $1-2x$ to account for the probability of the median being in $(x,1-x)$, adding it to the first term of $p(x)$ from above, and simplifying it all, we get $p(x) = 2x^3 - 4x^2 + 2x +\\dfrac{1}{3}$. To maximize $p(x)$, we take the derivative. Namely, $p'(x) = 6x^2 - 8x + 2$, of which the zeroes are $x^* = \\dfrac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 48}}{12} = \\dfrac{1}{3},1$. As $0 < x < \\dfrac{1}{2}$ (since then the regions would overlap), we conclude $x^* = \\dfrac{1}{3}$ is our maximizer, with $p(x^*) = \\dfrac{17}{27}$.",

Using the direct definition of LOTUS, we have $$\\mathbb{E}[X \\mid X < Y] = \\displaystyle \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k \\cdot \\mathbb{P}[X = k \\mid X < Y] = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k \\cdot \\dfrac{\\mathbb{P}[X = k, X < Y]}{\\mathbb{P}[X < Y]}$$ The numerator can be written as $\\mathbb{P}[X = k, Y > k] = \\mathbb{P}[X = k]\\mathbb{P}[Y > k]$ by independence of $X$ and $Y$. The PMF of $X$ is $\\mathbb{P}[X = k] = \\dfrac{1}{2^k}$ for integers $k \\geq 1$. Similarly, $\\mathbb{P}[Y > k]$ means that it takes more than $k$ flips for John to see his first heads, meaning all of the first $k$ flips are tails.

Therefore, $\\mathbb{P}[X > Y] + \\mathbb{P}[X < Y] + \\mathbb{P}[X = Y] = 1$. Substituting in the equality above, $\\mathbb{P}[X < Y] = \\dfrac{1 - \\mathbb{P}[X = Y]}{2}$.

    "task": "$2000$ soldiers get captured in war, including yourself. Rather than feeding information to the opposing side, you and your fellow soldiers decide it is honorable to kill one another until there is one person standing and they can kill themselves. However, you know that if you are the last person still alive, thereâs a good chance that you can escape and be free. The process in killing other soldiers is as follows: all soldiers stand in a circle and Person 1 starts with a sword. Person 1 kills Person 2 and gives the next soldier the sword (in this case Person 3). This process continues going around the circle till thereâs one person left. What position in this circle should you stand to be the last person alive?",
    "hint": "Start will a small $n$ where $n$ is the number of soldiers and try to spot a pattern.",
    "solution": "This is a classic brain teaser known as the Josephus Problem. The best way to solve this problem is to start with simpler cases and see which position is the last alive. When thereâs only $1$ person, Person 1 is the last to be alive (obviously). $2$ people, still Person 1. $3$ people, Person 3 is the last to remain alive. $4$ people, Person 1 is last. If you keep doing this, youâll notice that when there are $2^n$ soldiers, Person 1 is the last to be alive. The greatest power of $2$ that's less than or equal to $2000$ is $1024$. This means that $976$ soldiers have to be killed and then the person that has the sword will be the one to last be alive. After $n$ people have been killed, the $2n+1$ Person will have the sword. For our case, this comes out to $2*976+1 = 1953$. Thus you should be in the $1953^{rd}$ position of the circle to be the last person alive. $\\\\$ For a more general case with $N$ people in the circle, we can express $N$ as $2^n+r$ and the position last to survive is $2r+1$.",

    "hint": "Consider the area of the triangle. Can you relate this to the quantity that we want?",
    "solution": "Recall from euclidean geometry that the area of a triangle can be expressed as the product of its inradius and its semiperimeter. Following routine application of the pythagorean theorem, we find that the altitude of the triangle from the base of length $24$ is $4\\sqrt{7}$, so the area is $48\\sqrt{7}$. The semiperimeter, being half the perimeter, is $28$, so we can compute the inradius as $\\dfrac{12\\sqrt{7}}{7}$. The area of the incircle is $\\dfrac{144\\pi}{7}$, so our answer is $144 + 7 = 151$.",

    "task": "There are $N$ people standing in a circle labeled 1 through $N$, such that the smallest power of two less than or equal to $N$ is $X$. Starting with the person 1, they take a sword and kill the person to their left. Then, they pass the sword to the living person on their left, and the process continues until one person is left. The survivor's number can be expressed as $aN + bX + c$. Compute $a + 2b + 3c$.",
    "hint": "Notice that person 1 will always win if there are a total of $2^k$ people. What if it is not a power of $2$?",
    "solution": "Notice that person 1 will always win if there are a total of $2^k$ people. This is because powers of 2 can halve without a remainder. If $N$ is not a power of 2, then we simply need to eliminate the first $N - X$ people. The number of the person begins when there are $X$ total people left will win. Starting with player 1, we eliminate $N - X$ people, meaning that we kill every even-numbered player until $2(N - X)$, inclusive. Our survivor is therefore numbered $2(N - X) + 1 = 2N - 2X + 1$. Hence, $a + 2b + 3c = 1$.",

    "task": "Consider a line of $25$ adjacent colorless squares. Color in each individual square black or white with equal probability, independent of all other squares. A connected component is a maximal sequence of adjacent squares all with the same color. For example, BBWBWWWBBW has 6 connected components. Find the expected number of connected components in our line.",
    "hint": "Consider conditioning on whether or not the last square matches in color with the second to last square to derive a recurrence relation.",
    "solution": "Let $C_n$ be the number of connected components when we have $n$ squares in a line. We will derive a recurrence relation for $\\mathbb{E}[C_n]$. Suppose that we want to find $\\mathbb{E}[C_{n}]$, the expected number of connected components with $n$ squres in a row. We can find this by conditioning on the $n-1$st square. We know that with probability $\\dfrac{1}{2}$ each, it matches or differs from the $n-1$st square. If it matches, then we have $\\mathbb{E}[C_{n-1}]$ connected components, as we don't add in any new ones if it matches. If it differs, then we have $1 + \\mathbb{E}[C_{n-1}]$ connected components, as the differing color will add in a new component. Therefore, by Law of Total Expectation, $\\mathbb{E}[C_n] = \\dfrac{1}{2}\\cdot \\mathbb{E}[C_{n-1}] + \\dfrac{1}{2} \\cdot (1 + \\mathbb{E}[C_{n-1}]) = \\mathbb{E}[C_{n-1}] + \\dfrac{1}{2}$. This recurrence along with the initial condition that $\\mathbb{E}[C_1] = 1$ (as we have 1 component), yields the solution $\\mathbb{E}[C_n] = \\dfrac{n+1}{2}$. In particular, $n = 25$, so $\\mathbb{E}[C_{25}] = 13$.",

    "hint": "Try a few cases and understand how the Pigeonhole Principle may be useful.",
    "solution": "This is not possible. There are 5 odd and 4 even numbers, and for three numbers to sum to an even number, either one or three of the numbers must be even. In other words, we cannot have any row or column with two evens. Looking at the columns, by Pigeonhole Principle, there must be at least one column with all even numbers, because there are four even numbers for three columns, and no column can have only two even numbers as noted. However, once a column is stacked with three even numbers, the last even number will necessarily cause a row to have two even numbers, and thus that row will sum to an odd. Because there are no possible combinations where the sum of each row and column is even, the probability that the sum of each row and column is even is 0.",
