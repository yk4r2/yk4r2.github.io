        <div class="task">    <p>You are playing a one-player game with two opaque boxes. At each turn, you can choose to either "place" or "take". "Place" places $\$$1 from a third party into one box randomly. "Take" empties out one box randomly and that money is yours. This game consists of 100 turns where you must either place or take. Assuming optimal play, what is the expected payoff of this game? Note that you do not know how much money you have taken until the end of the game.</p>

This can also be proved with induction, and this will be left as an exercise to the reader. The next aspect is regarding the number of places and takes.</p></details>
<details>    <summary>Solution</summary><p>There are two aspects to this game that should be noted: the ordering of the places and takes, and the number of places and takes. We can tackle the former aspect first. Intuitively, no places should come after a take. Greedily so, you might as well put a take after all places such that you have a higher expected value of that take (considering a single take, every place you put after the take is $\$$1 less that could be taken); thus, all takes should be stacked at the end of the 100 turns. This can also be proved with induction, and this will be left as an exercise to the reader. The next aspect is regarding the number of places and takes. If there are $p$ places, then there must be $100-p$ takes, and we know that the $p$ places must occur before the $100-p$ takes. In order to find the value of $p$, we can calculate at what position does adding an additional place action not improve our expected payoff. Consider the $p$-th action where $1 &lt p &lt 100$ and where this is the last place before we begin taking, or the next action ($p+1$) will be the last pace before we begin taking. What is the expected value of the game if action $p$ is the last place? There are $p$ dollars in aggregate and we have $100-p$ takes. Our expected payoff will be $p \times \sum_{i=1} ^{100-p} \frac{1}{2^i}$, which can be seen from the linearity of expectation- at every take, we will take half of what is remaining on average. What is the expected value of the game if action $p+1$ is the last place? There are $p+1$ dollars in aggregate and we have $100-(p+1)$ takes. Thus, our expected payoff is $(p+1) \times \sum_{i=1} ^{100-p-1} \frac{1}{2^i}$. We are looking for the largest value of $p$ such that the payoff where the $p$-th place is the last place is greater the payoff where the incremental $p+1$-th place is the last place. Thus:$$p \sum_{i=1} ^{100-p} \frac{1}{2^i} &gt (p+1) \sum_{i=1} ^{100-p-1} \frac{1}{2^i}p \sum_{i=1} ^{100-p} \frac{1}{2^i} &gt p \sum_{i=1} ^{99-p} \frac{1}{2^i} + \sum_{i=1} ^{99-p} \frac{1}{2^i}\frac{p}{2^{100-p}} &gt \sum_{i=1} ^{99-p} \frac{1}{2^i}$$$\sum_{i=1} ^{99-p} \frac{1}{2^i}$ approaches 1, and thus $p &gt 2^{100-p} \Rightarrow p &gt 93$. With 94 places, the expected payoff is $94 \sum_{i=1} ^{6} \frac{1}{2^i} \approx 92.5$. To check this is the maximum payoff, we can look at the 93 and 95 placing cases. With 93 places, the expected payoff is $93 \sum_{i=1} ^{7} \frac{1}{2^i} \approx 92.3$. With 95 places, the expected payoff is $95 \sum_{i=1} ^{5} \frac{1}{2^i} \approx 92.0$. Both surrounding values are less than our expected payoff, and hence the optimal number of times we should place is 94 with an expected payoff of $\frac{2961}{32} \approx 92.5$.

        <div class="task">    <p>Every box of cereal contains one toy from a group of $5$ distinct toys, each of which is mutually independent from the others and is equally likely to be within a given box. How many distinct toys can you expect to collect if you bought $7$ boxes?</p>
<details>    <summary>Hint</summary><p>Try to define indicator random variables as a way to utilize the linearity of expectation. Notice that each toy follows the same distribution, despite mutual dependence.</p></details>
<details>    <summary>Solution</summary><p>Let $X$ be the number of distinct toys you collect from the set of 5 toys; we are looking for $E[X]$. Let $I_i$  ($i = 1,2,...,5$) be the indicator random variable where:$$I_i = \left\{   \begin{array}{ c l }    1 & \quad \textrm{if } \textrm{the $i$-th toy type exists in the set of seven boxes} \\    0                 & \quad \textrm{otherwise}  \end{array}\right.$$We can define $X$ as $\displaystyle X = I_1 + I_2 + ... + I_5 = \sum_{i=1} ^5 I_i$. For a particular toy type, the probability that it is not observed in the first box is $\frac{4}{5}$, and the probability that it is observed in none of the seven boxes is $(\frac{4}{5})^7$ since each box is independent. Therefore, the probability that it is observed in at least one of the seven boxes is $1 - (\frac{4}{5})^7$. Applying the linearity of expectation and the fact that each toy type follows the same distribution, we can solve for $E[X]:$$$E[X] = E\left[\sum_{i=1} ^5 I_i\right] = 5E[I_1] = 5 \times \left[1 \times \left(1 - \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^7\right)+ 0 \times \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^7\right] = \frac{61741}{15625}$$

Assuming that you do not know anyone else's birthday and that all birthdays are uniformly distributed across the 365 days in a normal year, what position in line will you choose to maximize your probability of receiving the free sundae?</p>
<details>    <summary>Hint</summary><p>Think of this as an optimization problem. How can you define the function you are trying to optimize?</p></details>
<details>    <summary>Solution</summary><p>You choose to be the $n$-th person in line. In order for you to get the free sundae, all of the first $n-1$ people ahead of you must have different birthdays, and your birthday needs to be the same as one of these individuals. Thus, the probability that you receive the free sundae is $P(n) = \frac{365 \times 364 \times ... \times (365-n+2)}{365^{n-1}} \times \frac{n-1}{365}.$ You may feel free to find the derivative with respect to $n$ and solve for $n$. Another approach would be to notice that the $n$ that we are solving for must be such that $P(n) &gt P(n-1)$ and $P(n) &gt P(n+1)$; or in other words, the value of $n$ maximizes $P(n)$.   $$P(n-1) = \frac{365}{365} \times \frac{364}{365} \times ... \times \frac{365 - (n-3)}{365} \times \frac{n-2}{365}$$  $$P(n) = \frac{365}{365} \times \frac{364}{365} \times ... \times \frac{365 - (n-2)}{365} \times \frac{n-1}{365}$$  $$P(n+1) = \frac{365}{365} \times \frac{364}{365} \times ... \times \frac{365 - (n-1)}{365} \times \frac{n}{365}$$   Thus,  $$P(n) &gt P(n-1) \Rightarrow n^2 - 3n - 363 &lt 0$$  $$P(n) &gt P(n+1) \Rightarrow n^2 - n - 365 &gt 0$$   We find that the value of $n$ that satisfies these two inequalities is 20.

<details>    <summary>Solution</summary><p>Let $p_n$ be the probability in question when we have $n$ IID Unif$(0,1)$ random variables. We want to find the smallest $n$ such that $p_n \geq 0.99$. The event that at least one of the random variables is in this interval is the complement of the event that all $n$ of the random variables are outside this interval. This latter probability is much easier to compute, as we have intersections of events now instead of unions.



Therefore, the probability of the complement is $1-p_n$, so we want to find the smallest $n$ such that $1 - p_n \leq 0.01$. Now, we want to find an expression for $1 - p_n$, the probability of the complement.



If the complement occurs, none of the $n$ IID random variables are in $(0.48,0.52)$. This is saying $\mathbb{P}[X_1 \notin (0.48,0.52), \dots X_n \notin (0.48,0.52)] = \mathbb{P}[X_1 \notin (0.48,0.52)]\dots \mathbb{P}[X_n \notin (0.48,0.52)]$ by independence. As all of the random variables have identical distributions, we can evaluate one of the probabilities and raise it to the $n$th power, so this is $(\mathbb{P}[X_1 \notin (0.48,0.52)])^n$. The probability $X_1$ is in $(0.48,0.52)$ is just $\dfrac{0.04}{1} = 0.04$. This is because we have a uniform density on $(0,1)$, so the probability our random variable belongs to some sub-interval is just the length of that interval over the total length of our supported interval. As the probability $X_1$ is in the interval is $0.04$, the probability it is not in the interval is $0.96$. 



All of this work above has led us to finding the smallest $n$ such that $(0.96)^n \leq 0.01$. Namely, we can solve this with logarithms to be $n = \text{ceil}\left(\dfrac{\ln(0.01)}{\ln(0.96)}\right) = 113$. We need to take ceilings as $n$ must be an integer and the floor would be too small and not satisfy the condition.</p></details>

<details>    <summary>Solution</summary><p>Note that $x = 37abc = 37000 + abc$. As $37$ already divides $37000$, we just need to find integers $abc$ such that all of $abc, bca,$ and $cab$ are divisible by $37$. Consider $abc - bca$. We will show that in fact any three digit integer $abc$ divisible by $37$ will automatically have the other two forms divisible by $37$ as well.     Let $abc$ be an integer divisible by 37. Then $abc = 100a + 10b + c$ by expanding out the digits. For the purposes of this solution, we will prove that if $abc$ is divisible by $37$, then $bca$ also is. The proof for $cab$ is also very similar.     By expanding digits again, $bca = 100b + 10c - a$. We have that $$abc - bca = (100a + 10b + c) - (100b + 10c + a) = 99a - 90b - 9c = -9(-11a + 10b + c)$$ Note that the form of the interior parenthesis is the same as it was originally but we have $-11a$ instead of $100a$. The difference between these is $-9 \cdot 111a = -999a$. As $999$ is divisible by $37$, we can subtract $999a$ and get that $abc - bca \equiv -9(100a + 10b + c)$ in mod $37$. However, $abc = 100a + 10b + c$ is divisible by 37 by assumption, so $abc - bca \equiv 0$ in mod $37$. As $abc$ is divisible by $37$, this implies $bca$ is also divisible by $37$.     With this in mind, the question is really just asking how many integers $abc$ at most $1000$ are divisible by $37$. In other words, how many non-negative integer values of $k$ are there such that $37k \leq 1000$. We have that $999$ is divisible by $37$ from before and $999 = 37 \cdot 27$. Therefore, $k = 0,1,\dots, 27$, all satisfy this, meaning there are 28 such values total.

<details>    <summary>Hint</summary><p>Write a recurrence relation for $E_n$, the expected number of free throws after $n$ total attempts.</p></details>
<details>    <summary>Solution</summary><p>Let $E_n$ denote the expected number of free throws made after $n$ total attempts. Then, $E_n = \frac{E_{n-1}}{n - 1} + E_{n-1}$. This is because there is a probability of $\frac{E_{n-1}}{n - 1}$ that the $n$-th free throw attempt is made, increasing the total by 1. Simplifying the expression, we find $E_n = \frac{n}{n-1} E_{n-1}$. Note that $E_3 = \frac{3}{2}$. The recurrence relation can be rewritten in terms of $n$: $E_n = \frac{n}{2}$. So, for $n = 100$, we have $E_{100} = 50$.  This can also be seen by the first iteration of this question, as our total throw we make is uniform on $\{1,2,\dots,99\}$, which has mean $50$.

<details>    <summary>Solution</summary><p>We can use the tail-sum formula for non-negative integer-valued random variables $\mathbb{E}[N] = \displaystyle \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \mathbb{P}[N &gt n]$. Clearly $\mathbb{P}[N &gt 0] = \mathbb{P}[N &gt 1] = 1$, as we need at least $2$ random variables to compare to get one that is not the max. Suppose that $n \geq 2$. Then the event $\{N &gt n\}$ means that $X_1 &lt X_2 &lt \dots &lt X_n$, which occurs with probability $\dfrac{1}{n!}$, as this is one specific ordering of the indices among $n!$ possible orderings. Therefore, $\mathbb{P}[N &gt n] = \dfrac{1}{n!}$. In particular, this holds for $n = 0,1$ as well, which is ideal. Summing up, $$\mathbb{E}[N] = \displaystyle \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \dfrac{1}{n!} = e$$ The answer is therefore $0 + 1 = 1$.

<details>    <summary>Solution</summary><p>After $x$ hours, a proportion of $1-\dfrac{x}{2}$ would be remaining from the $2$ hour candle, while $1-x$ would be remaining from the $1$ hour candle. We want to find $x$ such that $1-\frac{x}{2}= 2(1-x)$. This is because the $1$ hour candle burns faster. Therefore, solving this, we see that $x = \dfrac{2}{3}$. This means we should light both candles $40$ minutes before $4:00$ PM, which is $3:20$ PM. Thus, our answer is $1520$ in military time.

<details>    <summary>Hint</summary><p>Let $f_{k}$ be the expected number flips of the coin needed to obtain $10$ heads when you have $0 \leq k \leq 10$ heads consecutively obtained already. Use Law of Total Expectation to derive a recurrence for $f_k$ and notice a pattern.</p></details>
<details>    <summary>Solution</summary><p>We are going to solve this more generally for $n$ consecutive heads. Let $f_{k}$ be the expected number flips of the coin needed to obtain $n$ heads when you have $0 \leq k \leq n$ heads consecutively obtained already. Our boundary condition is that $f_n = 0$, as you already have all $n$ heads obtained. We can see that $f_{n-1} = \dfrac{1}{2} \cdot 1 + \dfrac{1}{2} \cdot (1 + f_0) = 1 + \dfrac{1}{2}f_0$, as with probability $1/2$, you reach $n$ heads, and with probability $1/2$, you start over. Similarly, we have that $$f_{n-2} = 1 + \dfrac{1}{2}f_{n-1} + \dfrac{1}{2}f_0 =1 + \dfrac{1}{2}\left(1 + \dfrac{1}{2}f_0\right)  + \dfrac{1}{2}f_0 = \dfrac{3}{2} + \dfrac{3}{4}f_0$$ By doing this again, we obtain $$f_{n-3} = 1 + \dfrac{1}{2}f_{n-2} + \dfrac{1}{2}f_0 = 1 + \dfrac{1}{2}\left(\dfrac{3}{2} + \dfrac{3}{4}f_0\right) + \dfrac{1}{2}f_0 = \dfrac{7}{4} + \dfrac{7}{8}f_0$$ A pattern now arises. By recursively applying this process, we can see that $$f_{n-k} = \left(2 - \dfrac{1}{2^{k-1}}\right) + \left(1 - \dfrac{1}{2^k}\right)f_0$$ By plugging in $k = n$, we obtain $$f_0 = f_0\left(1 - \dfrac{1}{2^n}\right) + 2 - \dfrac{1}{2^{n-1}} \iff \dfrac{1}{2^n}f_0 = 2 - \dfrac{1}{2^{n-1}} \iff f_0 = 2^{n+1} - 2$$ In particular, for $n = 10$, our answer is $2^{11} - 2 = 2046$.

<details>    <summary>Hint</summary><p>Consider this problem with $n$ coin flips. Let $t_n$ be the number of sequences of length $n$ where this is satisfied. For any such valid sequence of length $n$, it must end with either $H$ or $TT$. These subcases are both disjoint.

<details>    <summary>Solution</summary><p>Consider this problem with $n$ coin flips. Let $t_n$ be the number of sequences of length $n$ where this is satisfied. For any such valid sequence of length $n$, it must end with either $H$ or $TT$. These subcases are both disjoint.



If our sequence ends with $H$, we can have any satisfactory sequence for the first $n-1$ flips. Therefore, there are $t_{n-1}$ such sequences of flips satisfying this. If our sequence ends with $TT$, we can have any satisfactory sequence for the first $n-2$ flips. Therefore, there are $t_{n-2}$ such sequences of flips satisfying this case. Therefore, we obtain the recurrence $t_n = t_{n-1} + t_{n-2}$.



We now need some initial conditions. For $n = 1$, there is $1$ sequence satisfying this: $H$. For $n = 2$, there are $2$ sequences satisfying this: $HH$ and $TT$. Therefore, we can fully recognize this as $t_n = F_{n+1}$, where $F_n$ is the $n$th Fibonacci number. Thus, our probability is $\dfrac{F_{n+1}}{2^n}$. For $n = 10$, we get that our answer is $\dfrac{89}{1024}$.</p></details>

<details>    <summary>Solution</summary><p>The only way for a bowl to have $k$ cherries left is if the remaining $k$ cherries are all purple and the $k+1$-th cherryâcounting backwardsâis red. We now have a simple ordering problem: how many ways can $m$ red cherries and $n$ purple cherries be ordered such that the last $k$ cherries are purple and the $k+1$-th cherry from the end is red? 

We begin by assigning the last $k$ cherries as purple and the $k+1$-th cherry from the end as red. We are left with $m - 1$ red cherries and $n - k$ purple cherries to order however we'd like. Correcting for overcounting (since red cherries are indistinguishable from each other and purple cherries are indistinguishable from each other), we find that there are 
\[\begin{aligned}
    \frac{(m + n - k - 1)!}{(m-1)!\,(n - k)!}
\end{aligned}\]
possible orderings. 

There are a total of 
\[\begin{aligned}
    \frac{(m + n)!}{m! \, n!}
\end{aligned}\]
possible orderings of the $m$ red and $n$ purple cherries without the restriction. 

Thus, the probability is 

\[\begin{aligned}
    \frac{(m + n - k - 1)!}{(m-1)!\,(n - k)!} \cdot \frac{m! \, n!}{(m + n)!} = \frac{70}{429}
\end{aligned}\]

Alternatively, we know that the last three spots must be $RPP$, so the probability of this sequence is $\dfrac{5}{13} \cdot \dfrac{8}{12} \cdot \dfrac{7}{11} = \dfrac{70}{429}$</p></details>

<details>    <summary>Hint</summary><p>How many cards are actually of interest in this scenario? Can we discard all uninteresting cards and therefore simplify the problem?
    </div></details>
<details>    <summary>Solution</summary><p>We have $13$ cards of interest in this scenario, and we can ignore the other $39$. Initially, we have a $\frac{12}{13}$ chance to draw one of the cards that we need (being one of the $4$ kings, $4$ queens, or $4$ jacks). On our next draw, let's imagine we drew a king, then we have an $\frac{8}{12}$ chance to draw one of the cards that we need (being one of the $4$ queens or $4$ jacks). For our third draw, imagine we just drew a queen and the pattern continues, meaning we have a $\frac{4}{11}$ chance to draw one of the cards we need (being the $4$ jacks). For our last draw, we need the ace and just the ace, and we have a $\frac{1}{10}$ chance of doing so.

Combining all of the above probabilities, we get $$\frac{12}{13} \cdot \frac{8}{12} \cdot \frac{4}{11} \cdot \frac{1}{10} = \frac{16}{715}$$



For a more combinatorial approach, there are $3!$ ways to arrange around the jack, queen, and king that come before the two of hearts. There are $4$ ways to pick each of the suits from the three ranks above. After these three, the next card must be the two of hearts. Thus, there are $3! \cdot 4^3$ such sequences that satisfy our condition in the first four cards, and there are $13 \cdot 12 \cdot 11 \cdot 10$ total ways to draw the first four cards, so the probability is $$\dfrac{3! \cdot 4^3}{13 \cdot 12 \cdot 11 \cdot 10} = \dfrac{16}{715}$$</p></details>

Namely, $$\mathbb{P}[T_{100} &gt 30000] = \mathbb{P}[T_{100} - 25000 &gt 5000] \leq \mathbb{P}[|T_{100} - 25000| &gt 5000] \leq \dfrac{\text{Var}(T_{100})}{5000^2}$$ The inequality comes from the fact that $\{T_{100} - 25000 &gt 5000\} \subseteq \{|T_{100} - 25000| &gt 5000\}$. By the independence of the individual blocks of cheese, $\text{Var}(T_{100}) = 100\text{Var}(T_{100}) = 100 \cdot 250^2$, so we get the upper bound on the probability as $\dfrac{100 \cdot 250^2}{5000^2} = \dfrac{1}{4}$.

    <div class="content-area"
        <div class="task">    <p>Bob is singing the traditional song, â$N$ Bottles of Beer.â With each verse, he counts down the number of bottles. The first verse contains the lyrics â$N$ bottles of beer,â the second verse contains the lyrics â$N-1$ bottles of beer,â and so on. The last verse contains the lyrics â1 bottle of beer.â Thereâs just one problem: Bob has early onset Alzheimer's. When completing any given verse, he has a tendency to forget which verse he's on. When this happens, he finishes the verse he is currently singing and then goes back to the beginning of the song (with $N$ bottles) on the next verse.
 
For each verse, suppose you have a $\frac{1}{N}$ chance of forgetting which verse you are currently singing. Let $K$ denote the expected number of verses in the song. Compute $\lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} \frac{K}{N}$. The answer is in the form $ae-b$ for integers $a$ and $b$. Find $a^2 + b^2$.</p>
<details>    <summary>Hint</summary><p>Build a transition matrix between states. Recursively solve for $K$.</p></details>
<details>    <summary>Solution</summary><p>It is easy to construct a transition graph. Let $\mu_j$ denote the expected number of times Bob sings verses when the current verse contains the lyrics â$j$ bottles of beer.â Then, we can write the following equations modeling absorption time:
\[\begin{aligned}
    \mu_N &= 1 + \frac{1}{N} \mu_N + \frac{N - 1}{N} \mu_{N - 1} \\
    \mu_{N-1} &= 1 + \frac{1}{N} \mu_N + \frac{N - 1}{N} \mu_{N - 2} \\
    &\quad \vdots \\
    \mu_{j} &= 1 + \frac{1}{N} \mu_N + \frac{N - 1}{N} \mu_{j - 1} \\
    &\quad \vdots \\
    \mu_{2} &= 1 + \frac{1}{N} \mu_N + \frac{N - 1}{N} \mu_{1} \\
    \mu_1 &= 1
\end{aligned}\]
We simply need to solve for $K = \mu_N$. Let's begin substituting. 
\[\begin{aligned}
    \mu_N &= 1 + \frac{1}{N} \mu_N + \frac{N - 1}{N} \mu_{N - 1} \\
    &= 1 + \frac{1}{N} \mu_N + \frac{N - 1}{N} \left( 1 + \frac{1}{N} \mu_N + \frac{N - 1}{N} \mu_{N - 2} \right) \\
    &= \left(1 + \frac{N - 1}{N}\right)\left( 1 + \frac{\mu_N}{N} \right) + \left(\frac{N-1}{N}\right)^2 \mu_{N - 2} \\
    &= \left( 1 + \frac{N-1}{N} + \left(\frac{N - 1}{N}\right)^2 \right)\left( 1 + \frac{\mu_N}{N} \right) + \left(\frac{N-1}{N}\right)^3 \mu_{N - 3} \\
    &= \left( 1 + \frac{N-1}{N} + \left(\frac{N - 1}{N}\right)^2 + \ldots + \left( \frac{N - 1}{N} \right)^{N - 2}\right)\left( 1 + \frac{\mu_N}{N} \right) + \left(\frac{N - 1}{N}\right)^{N - 1} \mu_{1} \\
    &= \left( 1 + \frac{N-1}{N} + \left(\frac{N - 1}{N}\right)^2 + \ldots + \left( \frac{N - 1}{N} \right)^{N - 2}\right)\left( 1 + \frac{\mu_N}{N} \right) + \left(\frac{N - 1}{N}\right)^{N - 1}
\end{aligned}\]
Note that
\[\begin{aligned}
    1 + \frac{N-1}{N} + \left(\frac{N - 1}{N}\right)^2 + \ldots + \left( \frac{N - 1}{N} \right)^{N - 2} &= 1 \cdot \left( \frac{1 - \left(\frac{N - 1}{N}\right)^{N - 1}}{1 - \frac{N - 1}{N}} \right) \\
    &= N - N\left(\frac{N - 1}{N}\right)^{N - 1}
\end{aligned}\]
Substituting and solving for $\mu_N$, we find
\[\begin{aligned}
    \mu_N &= N - N\left(\frac{N - 1}{N}\right)^{N - 1} + \left( 1 - 1\left(\frac{N - 1}{N}\right)^{N - 1} \right) \mu_N + \left(\frac{N - 1}{N}\right)^{N - 1} \\
    \mu_N &= \frac{N - N\left(\frac{N - 1}{N}\right)^{N - 1}}{\left(\frac{N - 1}{N}\right)^{N - 1}} + \left(\frac{N - 1}{N}\right)^{N - 1}
\end{aligned}\]
Our final task is to compute
\[\begin{aligned}
    \lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{N} \left( \frac{N - N\left(\frac{N - 1}{N}\right)^{N - 1}}{\left(\frac{N - 1}{N}\right)^{N - 1}} + \left(\frac{N - 1}{N}\right)^{N - 1} \right)
\end{aligned}\]
Let's solve.
\[\begin{aligned}
    \lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{N} \left( \frac{N - N\left(\frac{N - 1}{N}\right)^{N - 1}}{\left(\frac{N - 1}{N}\right)^{N - 1}} + \left(\frac{N - 1}{N}\right)^{N - 1} \right) &= \lim_{N \rightarrow \infty}\left( \frac{1 - \left(\frac{N - 1}{N}\right)^{N - 1}}{\left(\frac{N - 1}{N}\right)^{N - 1}}  \right) + \lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} \left(\dfrac{1}{N} \cdot \left(\frac{N - 1}{N}\right)^{N - 1} \right)\\
    &= \lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} \left( \frac{N^{N-1} - (N-1)^{N-1}}{(N-1)^{N-1}} \right) + \lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} \left(\dfrac{1}{N} \cdot \left(\frac{N - 1}{N}\right)^{N - 1} \right) \\
    &= \lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} \left( \frac{N}{N-1}\right)^{N-1} - 1 + \lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} \left(\dfrac{1}{N} \cdot \left(\frac{N - 1}{N}\right)^{N - 1} \right)
\end{aligned}\]
Recall
\[\begin{aligned}
    e &= \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \left( 1 + \frac{1}{x} \right)^x \\
    &= \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \left( \frac{x + 1}{x} \right)^x
\end{aligned}\]
Let $x = N - 1$. 
\[\begin{aligned}
    e &= \lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} \left( \frac{N}{N - 1} \right)^{N - 1}
\end{aligned}\]
Similarly, 
\[\begin{aligned}
    \frac{1}{e} &= \lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} \left(\frac{N - 1}{N}\right)^{N - 1}
\end{aligned}\]
This means the last term goes to $0$, as we have the extra $\dfrac{1}{N}$ term out back.
Substituting, we find
\[\begin{aligned}
    \lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} \frac{K}{N} = \boxed{e - 1}
\end{aligned}\]

Our answer is $1^2 + 1^2 = 2$.</p></details>

        <div class="task">    <p>$9$ children of distinct ages (in years) were born with a fixed interval of time between consecutive children. The sum of the squares of the ages of all the children is equal to the square of their father's age. Assuming that the father is aged at most $60$, what is the father's age?</p>
<details>    <summary>Hint</summary><p>Let $m$ be the age of the middle child, $s$ be the spacing between the children's births, and $d$ be the age of the dad. Then our condition says that $(m-4s)^2 + (m-3s)^2 + \dots + m^2 + (m+s)^2  + \dots + (m+4s)^2 = d^2$. Try seeing what the dad's age must be divisible by.
    </div></details>
<details>    <summary>Solution</summary><p>Let $m$ be the age of the middle child, $s$ be the spacing between the children's births, and $d$ be the age of the dad. Then our condition says that $(m-4s)^2 + (m-3s)^2 + \dots + m^2 + (m+s)^2  + \dots + (m+4s)^2 = d^2$. After expanding and cancelling, this reduces to $d^2 = 9m^2 + 60s^2$. Since the RHS is a multiple of $3$, we have that $3 \mid d^2$, which means $3 \mid d$. Therefore, let $d = 3r$ for an integer $r$. This means that $9r^2 = 9m^2 + 60s^2$, which equivalent is $(r-m)(r+m) = \dfrac{20}{3}s^2$. Since the LHS is an integer, this means that $3 \mid s$ as well. 



For the youngest child to be born, we must have that $m - 4s \geq 0$, which means $m \geq 4s$. Therefore, we have that $d^2 \geq 9(4s)^2 + 60s^2 = 204s^2 \geq (14s)^2$. Therefore, $d \geq 14s$. Since $3 \mid s$ and $d \geq 60$, we must have that $s = 0, 3$. Since they are not of the same age, $s = 3$. Plugging this in, we have that $(r-m)(r+m) = 60$. We now need to find factorizations of $60$ that have an integer midpoint, as the midpoint of $r-m$ and $r+m$ is $r$. Namely, we see that $10\cdot 6$ and $30 \cdot 2$ both have integer midpoints. If we select the former, then $r = 8$ and $m = 2$, meaning that the middle child has age $2$. As $s = 3$, we would get some negative ages. Therefore, we must have that the midpoint is $r = 16$ and $m = 14$. This is now consistent, as the children would be aged $2,5,8,11,14,17,20,23,$ and $26$. Since the father's age is $3r$, we get that the father is aged $3 \cdot 16 = 48$.</p></details>

<details>    <summary>Solution</summary><p>Consider the dataset $Y$ that is sampled perfectly from a parabola far from the origin. Let $X_2$ be the dataset where each value of $X_1$ is squared. If $Y$ is far enough from the origin, $y \sim \alpha_1 + \beta_1 x_1$ has low $R^2$ since it is linear, while $Y$ is quadratic. Furthermore, $y \sim \alpha_2 + \beta_2 x_2 = \alpha_2 + \beta_2 x_1^2$ is also low $R^2$ because although it is a parabola, it is not able to be shifted around horzontally to match $Y$. Therefore, individually, these linear regressions have low $R^2$. However, the model $y \sim \alpha + \beta' x_1 + \beta'' x_2$ has $R^2 = 1$, as you can now shift the parabola around in the plane to perfectly match the non-noisy dataset $Y$. </p></details>

</p>
<details>    <summary>Hint</summary><p>Instead of analyzing the whole chess board, think about the coin only landing inside one square. </p></details>
<details>    <summary>Solution</summary><p>Because of the layout and symmetry of squares, we only need to consider if the coin fits in a 2 inch by 2 inch square. If it doesnât, we know that it overlaps onto a neighboring square and thus doesnât fit the criteria. In order to find the probability that a coin is fully within a square, we can calculate the area that the center of the coin can land in and divide it by the total area of a square. Given the radius of the coin is $0.5$ inches, it canât be any closer than $0.5$ inches to any edge of the square. This gives a total area that the center can land in of $(2-0.5-0.5)^2 = 1$ square inch. The total area of the square (and thus total area that the center of the coin can land in) is $2^2=4$ square inches. This gives us the answer of $\frac{1}{4}$ = $0.25$.

        <div class="task">    <p>$7$ orbs are labeled $1-7$ and are linked linearly in a vertical stack from the ceiling with orb 1 being a part of the ceiling and orb 7 being closest to the floor. Each orb is attached to adjacent orbs by a chain link. At each time step, one of the remaining links is going to be uniformly at random selected and cut. As a result, all the orbs below that link will fall and shatter. What is the expected number of cuts needed until orb 1 is the only remaining orb?</p>
<details>    <summary>Hint</summary><p>Let $a_n$ be the expected number of cuts needed with $n$ links. Condition on the position of the first cut to derive a recurrence relation for $a_n$ and then consider the difference $a_n - a_{n-1}$.
    </div></details>
<details>    <summary>Solution</summary><p>We are going to solve this for the general case of when there are $n$ links. Let $a_n$ be the expected number of cuts needed with $n$ links. We want to find a recurrence relation for $a_n$. To do this, let's consider what happens after the first cut. If we cut at link $k$, $1 \leq k \leq n$, where link $1$ connects orbs $1$ and $2$, then this means we have $k-1$ links above it still standing. Thus, we have added $1$ to our count and want to now find the same expectation but starting from $k-1$ links instead of $n$. Mathematically, this means that $a_n = \displaystyle \dfrac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n (1 + a_{k-1})$, as with probability $\dfrac{1}{n}$, we cut each given link on the first step. This is just Law of Total Expectation above, where we have conditioned on the position of the first cut. We index shift this sum by $1$ to get $a_n = \dfrac{1}{n} \displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (1 + a_k) = 1 + \dfrac{1}{n} \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_k$.



Now, consider $a_n - a_{n-1}$. Using the recurrence relation above, we obtain that $$a_n - a_{n-1} = \displaystyle 1 + \dfrac{1}{n}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}a_k - \left(1 + \dfrac{1}{n-1} \sum_{k=0}^{n-2}a_k\right) = \dfrac{1}{n} a_{n-1} + \left(\dfrac{1}{n} - \dfrac{1}{n-1}\right)\sum_{k=0}^{n-2} a_k$$ Note that $\dfrac{1}{n} - \dfrac{1}{n-1} = -\dfrac{1}{n(n-1)}$, so the above reduces to $$a_n - a_{n-1} = \displaystyle \dfrac{1}{n}a_{n-1} - \dfrac{1}{n}\left[\dfrac{1}{n-1} \sum_{k=0}^{n-2}a_k\right]$$ The term in brackets is just $a_{n-1} - 1$ by our original recurrence relation. Therefore, $a_n - a_{n-1} = \dfrac{1}{n}a_{n-1} - \dfrac{1}{n}(a_{n-1} - 1) = \dfrac{1}{n}$. Rearranging, $a_n = a_{n-1} + \dfrac{1}{n}$. Our initial condition on this that makes physical sense is that $a_1 = 1$, as we only have one link to select from and we cut it on our first trial.



With this initial condition, we can recurse and clearly see that $$a_n = a_{n-1} + \dfrac{1}{n} = a_{n-2} + \dfrac{1}{n-1} + \dfrac{1}{n} = \dots = a_1 + \dfrac{1}{2} + \dots + \dfrac{1}{n} = \sum_{k=1}^n \dfrac{1}{k}$$ Therefore, this is our solution for general $n$, and our specific case is when $n = 6$, as we have $6$ links. Thus, the final result is $\dfrac{49}{20}$.</p></details>

<details>    <summary>Solution</summary><p> We can avoid a really messy casework solution by thinking about the problem creatively. Suppose we have all 10 integers written out in order on paper. Our goal is to cover some of the integers with tiles such that only two tiles are side-by-side; covered integers belong in a subset of interest. Perhaps we can invent our own special tiles of different shapes that prevent some integers from being next to each other by design; then, we can simply find the number of arrangements of the tiles. Specifically, we can have a few tiles labeled $U$ for uncovered, a few tiles labeled $UC$ for uncovered-covered, and exactly one tile labeled $UCC$ for uncovered-covered-covered (this tile ensures that exactly one pair of consecutive integers is in the subset). In order to account for all cases, however, we need to have an additional slot at 0. We have the following cases: 

Case 1: There are 6 total integers in the subset. In other words, there are 4 $UC$ tiles and 1 $UCC$ tile. There are $\binom{5}{4} = 5$ ways to order these 5 tiles. 

Case 2: There are 5 total integers in the subset. In other words, there are 3 $UC$ tiles, 1 $UCC$ tile, and 2 $U$ tiles. There are $\binom{6}{3, 1, 2} = 60$ ways to order these 6 tiles. 

Case 3: There are 4 total integers in the subset. In other words, there are 2 $UC$ tiles, 1 $UCC$ tile, and 4 $U$ tiles. There are $\binom{7}{2, 1, 4} = 105$ ways to order these 7 tiles. 

Case 4: There are 3 total integers in the subset. In other words, there is 1 $UC$ tile, 1 $UCC$ tile, and 6 $U$ tiles. There are $\binom{8}{1, 1, 6} = 56$ ways to order these 8 tiles. 

Case 5: There are 2 total integers in the subset. In other words, is 1 $UCC$ tile, and 8 $U$ tiles. There are $\binom{9}{8} = 9$ ways to order these 9 tiles. 

Adding it all up, we conclude there are $5 + 60 + 105 + 56 + 9 = 235$ possible subsets that contain exactly 1 pair of consecutive integers. </p></details>

A theorem in geometry helps simplify this problem. When two parallel planes cut a sphere, the surface of the sphere between the two planes is called a zone. The theorem states that the zone is proportional to the distance between the planes. This means that our coin should be $\dfrac{1}{3}$ as thick as the sphere's diameter.  In this case, the "planes" are the head and tail faces of the coin, as we inscribe our cylinder into a sphere.



The question here is how thick is the sphere? Let's call the radius $R$. The Pythagorean Theorem gives that $$R^2 = 1^2 + \left(\dfrac{R}{3}\right)^2$$ This is because the distance from the center of the coin to the upper face is the radius of the sphere. Additionally, we know that the radius of the coin is $1$ and the thickness (height) of the coin is $\dfrac{R}{3}$ from before. Solving this yields $R = \dfrac{3}{\sqrt{8}}$. However, we want $\dfrac{1}{3}(2R) = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$. We want $2R$ because that is the diameter, and hence how thick the coin should be. Our answer is $k = 2$. </p></details>

<details>    <summary>Solution</summary><p>Consider indicator random variables on each pair of chords. Any pair of chords will have a total of $4$ endpoints, and each of the ${4\choose2} = 6$ ways to pair them up into chords are equally likely, of which only $2$ result in an intersection. Alternatively, this can be seen by choosing two points for the first chord and computing the probability that two randomly chosen points would lie on the same side of the chord via integrating over the arc angle between the points of the first chord. Hence for each of the ${10\choose2} = 45$ pairs of chords, there are $1/3$ expected intersections for a total number of $15$.

        <div class="task">    <p>Consider a particle that performs a random walk on the integers starting at position $0$. At each step, the particle moves from position $i$ to position $i+1$ with probability $p$, while the probability it moves from $i$ to $i-1$ is $1-p$. If $p = 1/3$, find the probability the particle ever reaches position $1$.</p>
<details>    <summary>Hint</summary><p>Use Law of Total Probability to condition on what happens at the first step.</p></details>
<details>    <summary>Solution</summary><p>We are going to solve this for more general $p$. Let $x_1$ be the probability that the particle ever reaches position $1$. The key is to condition on the move at the first step. If the particle moves right, which occurs with probability $p$, then position $1$ is reached. Otherwise, the particle reaches position $-1$. From $-1$, the particle first needs to reach $0$ again, which occurs with probability $x_1$, and then from there, reach position $1$, which occurs with probability $x_1$ as well. Therefore, given the particle moves left, the probability it reaches position $1$ is $x_1^2$. This gives rise to the equation $$x_1 = p + (1-p)x_1^2$$ We can solve for this quadratic in $x_1$ to get that $x_1 = 1, \dfrac{p}{1-p}$. Since $x_1 \leq 1$, we know that for $p \geq 1/2$, $x_1 = 1$, as the other root would be larger than $1$. For $p &lt 1/2$, the random walk is biased down, so it is not probability $1$ that the particle ever reaches $1$. This argument can be made more rigorous using more mathematically advanced tools, but those are not of concern here. Therefore, the answer for $p &lt 1/2$ is $\dfrac{p}{1-p}$. Since $p = 1/3$ in this question, our answer is $\dfrac{1/3}{1-1/3} = \dfrac{1}{2}$.

        <div class="task">    <p>Let $W_t$ be a standard Brownian Motion. Let $X_t$ be a process satisfying the SDE $$dX_t = \kappa(\theta-X_t)dt - \sigma\sqrt{X_t}dW_t$$ with $X_0 = x &gt 0$. It can be shown (you do not need to do this) that if $\dfrac{2\kappa}{\theta} &gt \sigma^2$, $X_t &gt 0$ with probability $1$, so $\sqrt{X_t}$ is defined almost surely. For $T &gt 0$, $\mathbb{E}[X_T]$ can be written as a function of $x,\kappa,\theta,\sigma,$ and $T$. Evaluate this function when $T = 10, \kappa = 0.2, \theta = 2, x = 5,$ and $\sigma = 0.1$. The answer will be in the form $A + Be^C$ for integers $A,B,$ and $C$. Find $ABC$.</p>
<details>    <summary>Hint</summary><p>Calculate $d(e^{\kappa t}X_t)$ via Ito's Formula. Afterwards, express $e^{\kappa T}X_T - X_0$ as a sum of Lebesgue and Ito integrals. A "sufficiently nice" integrand inside an Ito integral has mean $0$.</p></details>
<details>    <summary>Solution</summary><p>First, we are going to calculate $d(e^{\kappa t}X_t)$. By the product rule, we have that $$d(e^{\kappa t}X_t) = \kappa e^{\kappa t} X_tdt + e^{\kappa t} dX_t = \kappa e^{\kappa t} X_t + e^{\kappa t} \left(\kappa(\theta - X_t)dt - \sigma \sqrt{X_t} dW_t\right)$$ Distributing everything, we get the first term cancels with the $-\kappa X_t dt$ term inside the parentheses, so we are left with $$d(e^{\kappa t} X_t) = \kappa \theta e^{\kappa t} dt - \sigma e^{\kappa t} \sqrt{X_t} dW_t$$ We can use this to get $e^{\kappa t}X_t$ very simply by integrating both sides. Namely, $$e^{\kappa t}X_t - X_0 = \displaystyle \int_0^t \kappa \theta e^{\kappa s} ds - \int_0^t \sigma e^{\kappa s}\sqrt{X_s} dW_s$$ Rearranging to isolate $X_t$, we have that $$X_t = X_0e^{-\kappa t} + \displaystyle \int_0^t \kappa \theta e^{\kappa(s - t)}ds - \int_0^t \sigma e^{\kappa(s-t)}\sqrt{X_s}dW_s$$ Now, we know that $X_0 = x$, so we can substitute that in. In addition, the second integral is Ito and the function inside is "sufficiently nice" to conclude that the mean of it is $0$. Thus, $$\mathbb{E}[X_T] = xe^{-\kappa T} + \displaystyle \int_0^T \kappa \theta e^{\kappa(s - T)} ds = xe^{-\kappa T} + \theta e{-\kappa T} e^{\kappa s} \Big|_0^T = xe^{-\kappa T} + \theta\left(1 - e^{-\kappa T}\right)$$ Evaluating this at the specific values, our expectation evaluates to $5e^{-2} + 2(1 - e^{-2}) = 2 + 3e^{-2}$. The answer is thus $3 \cdot 2 \cdot (-2) = -12$.

        <div class="task">    <p>Suppose that $X,Y,$ and $Z$ are three random variables. We know that Corr$(X,Y) = \dfrac{5}{13}$ and Corr$(Y,Z) = \dfrac{12}{13}$. The range of possible values for Corr$(X,Z)$ is an interval in the form $[0,b]$, where $b$ is a fraction in fully reduced form. Find $b$.</p>
<details>    <summary>Hint</summary><p>The key idea here is that the correlation matrix for any collection of random variables must be positive semi-definite. A condition to show that a matrix is positive definite is that each of the sub-matrices of order $1 \times 1, 2 \times 2, \dots, n \times n$, where $n$ is a size of the matrix, originating from the top left corner have positive determinant. The case where you have determinant of $0$ can be individually analyzed.
    </div></details>
<details>    <summary>Solution</summary><p>The key idea here is that the correlation matrix for any collection of random variables must be positive semi-definite. Denoting Corr$(X,Z) = \rho$, the correlation matrix for $(X,Y,Z)$, say $C$, is a $3 \times 3$ matrix 
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & \frac{5}{13} & \rho \\
\frac{5}{13} & 1 & \frac{12}{13} \\
\rho & \frac{12}{13} & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$



A condition to show that a matrix is positive definite is that each of the sub-matrices of order $1 \times 1, 2 \times 2, \dots, n \times n$, where $n$ is a size of the matrix, originating from the top left corner have non-negative determinant. In this case, it is easy to see that the top left $2\times 2$ matrix has determinant $C_{11}C_{22} - C_{12}C_{21} = \dfrac{144}{169} &gt 0$, so we only need to check that the entire matrix $C$ has non-negative determinant.



Evaluating this determinant as a function of $\rho$, we obtain that it is $\dfrac{120}{169}\rho - \rho^2$. Setting this equal to $0$, we obtain that $\rho = 0,\dfrac{120}{169}$. As this polynomial had a negative leading coefficient for $\rho^2$, it follows that the parabola (i.e. determinant) must have been positive between the two roots, so $\rho^* = \dfrac{120}{169}$ is the largest value where this determinant is non-negative.</p></details>

The base of the ladder is in oil, which makes the base slip and the tip of the ladder slide down the wall. The base of the ladder slips away from the wall at a constant rate of $4$ feet per minute. Find the rate at which the angle between the ladder and ground is decreasing (in radians per minute) when the base of the ladder is $30$ feet away from the wall.</p>
<details>    <summary>Hint</summary><p>Use the result of Slippery Ladder I and also $\tan\theta = \dfrac{y}{x}$.</p></details>
<details>    <summary>Solution</summary><p>We can view the ladder as the hypotenuse of a triangle whose sites are the ground and the wall. Using Pythagorean Theorem, we find that $$30^2 + y^2 = 50^2 \iff y = 40$$ Therefore, the tip of the ladder is $40$ feet above ground at that time. Using the result from Slippery Ladder I that $y' = -3$ at this instant, we can find the rate of change of the angle by using $\tan\theta = \dfrac{y}{x}$ Taking the derivative of both sides, we see that $$\sec^2\theta \theta' = \dfrac{xy' - yx'}{x^2}$$ We know that $y = 40$ and $x = 30$ at this instant, so $\sec^2\theta = 1 + \tan^2\theta = 1 + \dfrac{y^2}{x^2} = \dfrac{25}{9}$. With all of this information, we plug in and get $$\dfrac{25}{9}\theta' = \dfrac{30(-3) - 40(4)}{30^2} \iff \theta' = -\dfrac{1}{10}$$

$$\\$$

Give the result in the form: $\max^2 + \min^2$
</p>
<details>    <summary>Hint</summary><p>Draw a payoff diagram for the bull call spread</p></details>
<details>    <summary>Solution</summary><p>If we look at the payoff diagram of a bull call spread, we have $V_T = 0, S_T \in [0,5]$, $V_T = S_T - 5, S_T \in [5,10]$ and $V_T = 10, S_T \in [5, \infty)$.

So, in the worst case, we will gain $0$ and in the best case, we will gain $5$. In general, a bull call spread can cap the upside, but can also limit the downside loss. This option contract is the best when an investor expects a moderate increase in the stock (i.e it stays in the range of $K_1$ and $K_2$). </p></details>

The condition states that in the $10$ flips, we have $4$ more heads than tails, so this means that there are $7$ movements up and $3$ movements down. In other words, each valid sequence corresponds to some ordering of $UUUUUUUDDD$. There are $\displaystyle \binom{10}{3} = 120$ such arrangements, so this is our answer.

<details>    <summary>Solution</summary><p>The implied odds of the respect horses are $1/2, 1/4,$ and $1/6$, respectively. These sum to strictly less than $1$, so there is an arbitrage. We want to make a constant amount of money regardless of the outcome. Namely, if we bet our money in proportions $\$6/11, \$3/11,$ and $\$2/11$ in order on the three horses, we see that regardless of the outcome, we get a payout of $\$12/11$. However, we only bet $\$1$, yielding a profit of $\$1/11$ always. 



We obtain our proportions because the sum of the probabilities is $11/12$, so all we need to do is bet in a way that yields a constant positive expected payout relative to the probabilities of each horse winning. </p></details>

<details>    <summary>Solution</summary><p>In order for the ants to not meet at any corner, all three ants have to travel in the same direction (either clockwise or counter-clockwise). The probability they all travel clockwise is $(\frac{1}{2})^3=\frac{1}{8}$. The probability they all travel counter-clockwise is also $(\frac{1}{2})^3=\frac{1}{8}$. Thus, the probability the ants are on their unique corners is $\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{8}=\frac{1}{4}$.

        <div class="task">    <p>Lightning McQueen, Doc Hudson, and Chick Hicks all race in the Piston Cup to run it back. They race around an $1$ kilometer track. It turns out that Lightning McQueen is first, Doc Hudson is second, and Chick Hicks is third. Lightning McQueen finishes his lap $200$ meters ahead of Doc Hudson. Furthermore, Doc Hudson finishes his lap $200$ meters ahead of Chick Hicks. Assuming that each car moves with a constant speed, at the moment when Lightning McQueen finishes his lap, how many meters is Chick Hicks away from finishing his lap?</p>
<details>    <summary>Hint</summary><p>To solve this, we must obtain the relative speed of Lightning McQueen to Chick Hicks. Let $s$ be the speed Chick Hicks. How fast does Doc Hudson move relative to Chick Hicks?
    </div></details>
<details>    <summary>Solution</summary><p>To solve this, we must obtain the relative speed of Lightning McQueen to Chick Hicks. Let $s$ be the speed Chick Hicks. Doc Hudson must move at a speed of $\dfrac{5}{4}s$, as Doc Hudson moves $1000$ meters in the time that Chick Hicks moves $800$ meters. Similarly, Lightning McQueen must move at a rate of $\dfrac{5}{4}\left(\dfrac{5}{4}s\right) = \dfrac{25}{16}s$ by the same logic of comparing his distance travelled to Doc Hudson. 




Since Lightning McQueen moves at a speed $\dfrac{25}{16}$ times as large as Chick Hicks, this says that if Lightning McQueen covers a distance $d$, Chick Hicks covers a distance of $\dfrac{16}{25}d$. In particular, $d = 1000$ here, so Chick Hicks has travelled $640$ meters in the lap, meaning he is $360$ meters away from finishing his lap.</p></details>

        <div class="task">    <p>You have two assets. We will call them asset $1$ and asset $2$. Asset $1$ has an expected return of $4\%$ and a variance of $15\%$. Asset $2$ has an expected return of $2\%$ and a variance of $4\%$. They have a correlation $\rho = -1$. 
$$\\$$

We want to create a risk-free portfolio using assets $1$ and $2$. We will denote $w_1$ and $w_2$ as the weights of asset $1$ and $2$ in the portfolio respectively. Assume that $w_1 + w_2 = 1$. What is $w_1$? Give the answer to $2$ decimal points. 

</p>
<details>    <summary>Hint</summary><p>Construct a portfolio of asset $1$ with $w_1 = w$ and asset $2$ with $w_2 = 1 - w$. What is the variance of $w X_1 + (1 - w)X_2$, where $X_1$ and $X_2$ are assets $1$ and $2$ respectively?</p></details>
<details>    <summary>Solution</summary><p>Let's denote $w_1 = w$ and $w_2 = 1 - w$. In a $2$ asset world, we can write the variance of a portfolio as: $\sigma^2 = w^2 \sigma_1^2 + 2w(1-w)\rho\sigma_1\sigma_2 + (1 - w)^2 \sigma_2^2$. For a risk-less portfolio, we require $\sigma = 0$. Plugging in $\rho = -1$ and solving for $w_1 = w$. We obtain:
$$w = \frac{\sigma_2}{\sigma_1 + \sigma_2}$$

This gives us $w = \frac{\sqrt{.04}}{\sqrt{.15} + \sqrt{.04}} \approx 0.34$.

We see that the expected returns do not matter. We can obtain a riskless portfolio from two assets if they have a correlation of $-1$ and weight them using the above manner. This rarely happens in real life. </p></details>

        <div class="task">    <p>On average, how many cards in a normal deck of 52 playing cards do you need to flip over to observe your first ace?</p>
<details>    <summary>Hint</summary><p>How can you use the linearity of expectation to distribute expectation across a sum of random variables, regardless of independence?
    </div></details>
<details>    <summary>Solution</summary><p>The four aces are dispersed throughout the deck and cut the 48 remaining cards into 5 distinct sections, each of some random length $X_{i} \in [0, 48]$ where $1 \leq i \leq 5$; that is, $\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^5 X_i = 48$. Furthermore, by symmetry, $E[X_1] = E[X_2] = \dots = E[X_5]$, as in the absence of any additional information, none of the sections is expected to be any larger or smaller than any other. Thus, by linearity of expectation:
$$E\left[\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^5 X_i\right] = 5\times E[X_1] = 48 \Rightarrow E[X_1] = \frac{48}{5}$$

We have found that the expected number of cards in the first section is $\frac{48}{5}$, so we will observe the first ace on the next card. Hence, we expect to flip $\frac{48}{5}+1 = 10.6$ cards to observe the first ace.</p></details>

        <div class="task">    <p>Calculate the probability that when we roll $4$ fair $6-$sided dice, the sum of their upfaces is 20.</p>
<details>    <summary>Hint</summary><p>Count the different permutations that sum of $20$. Alternatively, condition on the sum of the first $2$ dice.</p></details>
<details>    <summary>Solution</summary><p>Clearly there are $6^4 = 1296$ total outcomes of the 4 dice rolls. We need to divide this up into all of the permutations that sum to 20, as well as count all of their arrangements. The permutations that sum to 20 are $$6,6,6,2; 6,6,5,3; 6,6,4,4; 6,5,5,4; 5,5,5,5$$ by brute force. Note that we now need to count all of the arrangements for each combination, as we created our sample space so that it include all 4-tuples. For $6,6,6,2$, there are $4$ permutations corresponding to where the 2 is put. For $6,6,5,3$, there are $12$ permutations corresponding to just dividing $4!$ (total permutations) by $2!$ for the two sixes. By the same idea, $6,6,4,4$ has 6 permutations, $6,5,5,4$ has 12 permutations, and $5,5,5,5$ has $1$ permutation. Adding all of these up, we get $35$ possible permutations that add to $20$. Therefore, the probability is $\dfrac{35}{1296}$.

        <div class="task">    <p>$k \geq 2$ people play a game as follows: Each of the $k$ people go up one-at-a-time to draw $1 \leq r \leq n$ balls without replacement from an urn that contains $n$ balls labelled $1-n$. Once a given person has drawn their $r$ balls, they note them, and then put them back in the urn for the next player to draw. Let $p(k,n,r)$ be the probability that all $k$ of the people draw at least one ball in common under the specifications above. Find $p(4,17,5)$. Round your answer to three decimal places.</p>

<details>    <summary>Solution</summary><p>Let $A_i$ be the event that ball $i$, $1 \leq i \leq r$, is selected in common between all $k$ people. We want $\mathbb{P}\left[\displaystyle\bigcup_{i=1}^r A_i\right]$. The events $A_i$ are not mutually exclusive, so we need to use inclusion-exclusion here to calculate this probability. As all of the balls are exchangeable, all individual probabilities and intersection probabilities are the same regardless of which intersection we consider. Therefore, by the inclusion-exclusion formula, we have that $$\mathbb{P}\left[\displaystyle\bigcup_{i=1}^r A_i\right] = \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^r (-1)^{i+1} \binom{n}{i}\mathbb{P}\left[\displaystyle\bigcap_{m=1}^i A_m\right]$$ We get the $\displaystyle \binom{n}{i}$ term from the fact that there are $\displaystyle {n \choose i}$ ways to select $i$ of the $n$ balls to be in common to everyone. The $(-1)^{i+1}$ term comes from the inclusion-exclusion formula itself. All that remains is to compute the intersection probability.



The event $\displaystyle \bigcap_{m=1}^i A_m$ means that all of the first $i$ balls are in common to all $k$ people selecting. Therefore, fix those $i$ balls. We now need to select $r-i$ balls from the remaining $n-i$ in the urn per person, which can be done in $\displaystyle \binom{n-i}{r-i}$ ways. The total number of ways to select $r$ balls from $n$ is $\displaystyle \binom{n}{r}$, so the probability that any individual person selects the first $i$ balls is $$\dfrac{\displaystyle \binom{n-i}{r-i}}{\displaystyle \binom{n}{r}}$$ As this needs to be done for all $k$ people, we raise the previous term to the $k$th power. Therefore, we get our final answer of $$p(k,n,r) = \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^r (-1)^{i+1} \binom{n}{i}\left[\dfrac{\displaystyle \binom{n-i}{r-i}}{\displaystyle \binom{n}{r}}\right]^k$$ Plugging in the respective values, we get that $$p(4,17,5) = 103566035/840373563 \approx 0.123$$</p></details>
