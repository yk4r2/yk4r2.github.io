    "hint": "We can interpret the information as saying that it takes us at least $5$ coin flips to obtain our first heads. Use the memorylessness of the geometric distribution.",
    "solution": "We can interpret the information as saying that it takes us at least $5$ coin flips to obtain our first heads. We want to find the probability that it takes up no more than $8$ coin flips to obtain our first heads. The \"at least $5$ flips\" portion means that the first $4$ flips were all tails. Therefore, from $4$ tails, find the probability the first head occurs on or before the $8$th flip. Given the memorylessness of the geometric distribution, this is really asking the probability we obtain a heads in the next $4$ flips.\n\n\nThe complement is easy to compute, which is the event that we don't obtain a heads in the next $4$ flips. The probability of all tails for the next $4$ flips is $\\dfrac{3^4}{4^4} = \\dfrac{81}{256}$. Therefore, the probability we do get a heads in the next $4$ flips is $1 - \\dfrac{81}{256} = \\dfrac{175}{256}$.",

    "task": "A $3$-headed dragon is attacking your village! You, the mightiest of knights, are tasked with taking down this dragon with your trusty sword. The dragon is defeated if you chop off all of its heads. However, this dragon uses magic and has the ability to grow heads over time! If you attack the dragon, one of three events can happen. You either chop of $2$ of its heads, you chop of $1$ head (which will ALWAYS grow back), or you miss entirely and the dragon grows $1$ head. The probability you chop of $2$ heads and miss the dragon are the same (assuming the dragon has $2$ or more heads). You know that if the dragon has $5$ or more heads, the dragon is too strong for you to take care of (in which case you and the rest of the villagers will perish). What is the probability you defeat the dragon?",
    "hint": "How can we model the different states of this scenario?",
    "solution": "Since there are changing states to this situation, we need to employ a Markov Chain to answer this question. Each state is differentiated by the amount of heads the dragon has. Let $P_{x}$ be the probability you defeat the dragon when the dragon is at $x$ heads. We already know that $P_{0}=1$ and $P_{5}=0$, thus we need to make equations for every other state in between. Also, its important to notice you are either going to a state with two less, the same amount, or one more head. Since the probability of going down two heads is the same as one more head, the probability of each scenario happening is $\\frac{1}{2}$ as if you repeat the same state, you'll still have to either go down two heads or up one head again. Also, when the dragon is at one head, you will either stay at the same number or increase the number of heads by one, so $P_{1}=P_{2}$. Every other state equation is as follows:\n$$P_{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot P_{0}+\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot P_{3}$$\n$$P_{3} = \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot P_{1}+\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot P_{4}$$\n$$P_{4} = \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot P_{2} + \\frac{1}{3}\\cdot P_{5}$$\n\nSolving all these equations, we obtain the answer of $P_{3} = \\frac{3}{5}$.",

    "solution": "We can replicate a binary strangle as a binary call with strike $K = 20$ and a binary put with strike $K = 15$. We don't have a binary put, so we must replicate the $K = 15$ binary put with a $K = 15$ binary call. We know that $P_0 = Z_0 - C_0 = 0.9 - 0.73 = 0.17$. \n\nCombining it all, we obtain $V_0 = C_0 + P_0 = 0.13 + 0.17 = 0.30$",

    "task": "Find the average number of people needed for there to be a pair of people with adjacent birthdays. Round your answer to the nearest tenth. You may assume the standard assumptions of the birthday problem i.e. $365$ days in a year, birthdays are independent, etc. We count December $31$ and January $1$ to be adjacent. It may be good to use computer software to evaluate the answer.",
    "hint": "Let $N$ be the number of people needed for this to occur. Then $\\mathbb{E}[N] = \\displaystyle \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\mathbb{P}[N \\geq k]$. What does the event $\\{N \\geq k\\}$ mean here?",
    "solution": "Let $N$ be the number of people needed for this to occur. Then $\\mathbb{E}[N] = \\displaystyle \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\mathbb{P}[N \\geq k]$ by our alternative form of expectation. The event $\\{N \\geq k\\}$ here means that none of the first $k-1$ people in the room share adjacent birthdays. Each birthday removes $3$ possible days for the remaining people to have. Therefore, the $i$th person entering the room has $365 - 3(i-1) = 368 - 3i$ possible days for their birthday to not have it overlap with any other birthday. This means that $$\\mathbb{P}[N \\geq k] = \\dfrac{365}{365} \\cdot \\dfrac{362}{365} \\cdot \\dfrac{359}{365} \\cdot \\dots \\cdot \\dfrac{368 - 3k}{365} = \\dfrac{\\displaystyle \\prod_{i=1}^k (368-3i)}{365^k}$$ Now, we sum over the support of $N$. There are $365$ possible birthdays, and each person entering removes up to $3$ days. Therefore, we know that $N \\leq 122$ with probability $1$, as with $122$ people, there must be a pair that is adjacent. This is because if none were adjacent, the $122$ people would block out $122 \\cdot 3 = 366 > 365$ days, which is not possible. Thus, two must overlap. Therefore, we can stop our sum at $122$. Our final expectation is $$\\mathbb{E}[N] = \\displaystyle \\sum_{k=1}^{122} \\dfrac{\\displaystyle \\prod_{i=1}^k (368-3i)}{365^k} \\approx 13.5$$",

    "hint": "Because both $HHT$ and $HTT$ begin with heads, we can ignore any pattern with leading tails. Instead, consider the four outcomes of flipping the coin three times. For each case, what is the probability that HHT or HTT will occur before the other?",
    "solution": "Both $HHT$ and $HTT$ begin with heads, so we can ignore any pattern with leading tails. Consider the case where our sequence begins with heads. Given that the first flip is heads, each of the following four cases occurs with probability $\\frac{1}{4}$: $HHH$, $HHT$, $HTH$, $HTT$. In the case of $HHH$, then Audrey will see the pattern $HHT$ first with probability $1$, since it is impossible for her to roll two tails without first seeing $HHT$. In the case of $HHT$, $HHT$ appears first. In the case of $HTT$, $HTT$ appears first. And finally, in the case of $HTH$, we are returned to our original state of our sequence of interest beginning with heads. Since $HHT$, $HTT$, and $HHH$ occur with equal probability, and since $HHT$ and $HHH$ result in $HHT$ appearing first, the probability that $HHT$ appears first is $\\frac{2}{3}$.",
